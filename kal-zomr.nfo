   |  Sorry for our previous release, It froze a bit into the game in the   |
   |  4th level. This has been fixed and we have released a repack because  |
   |  a PPF patch is not possible. You can expect a 1ST_READ.BIN Fix for    |
   |  people that want to remaster the game on their own rather than        |
   |  downloading this soon, though. Our apologies for the mistake and here |
   |  is the game fixed. Enjoy.                                             |
   |                                                                        |
   |  BURY THE UNDEAD - FOREVER.                                            |
   |                                                                        |
   |  It takes both firepower and fist-power to wipe out the ultimate army: |
   |  a legion of hideous killer Zombies that pack a gruesome punch. A      |
   |  top-secret government plan to turn the dead into a deadly fighting    |
   |  machine has fallen into sinister hands. You must lead a team of       |
   |  special agents and rescue a city under siege by this relentless       |
   |  force of "recyclable" soldiers. But how are you going to stop them    |
   |  if they're already dead? The monster arcade hit Zombie Revenge has    |
   |  invaded Sega Dreamcast with more action-packed gameplay than ever     |
   |  before. Strewn with branching paths, hidden areas, secret weapons,    |
   |  and shortcuts, each game becomes a new grisly adventure. Take the     |
   |  "un" out of "undead" as you beat these bio-engineered super-warriors, |
   |  and save the country from their horror.                               |
   |                                                                        |
   |  - Fully interactive 3D worlds where almost anything you pick up can   |
   |    be used as a weapon.                                                |
