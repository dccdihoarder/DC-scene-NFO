         To all the Suckers out there it better or fuck u, thats all to 
         this point!

         The game is Wetrix Plus Multi3 (english, german, french) and u can 
         find a 60Hz option in the options menu! 
         The game is not dummied cause the grafix are so small that it 
         would have been only a waste of time, and burner life!

         How it works:
         Just run inject.exe before u load the image with DJ, and wait 
         till its done! Then burn it as usuall with DJ 3.xxx! 
      .                                                                 .
