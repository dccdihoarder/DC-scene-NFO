   | This is the June 5 2001 build of Dreamcast Linux. Notable features     |
   | include xmame and xwindows , along with prBoom, a Doom clone. Of       |
   | course we didn't stick you ROMless and left playing the shareware      |
   | DOOM wadfile; this release is packaged with > 200 small MAME roms, and |
   | it also comes with the wadfile for The Ultimate Doom.                  |
   | PLEASE NOTE THAT THERE IS NO SOUND SUPPORT FOR ANY OF THIS - yet.      |
   | It hasn't been integrated to the Linux distro yet. ALSO, this is an    |
   | operating system so the keyboard is REQUIRED. Mouse is a plus too.     |
   | prBoom (your Doom clone) will run slow. Sorry, I can't control it.     |
   | Some MAME roms will run better than others, but none will have sound   |
   | The coder mentions on his site http://www.m17n.org/linux-sh/dreamcast/ |
   | that a VGA box would be best to use if you have one; the system goes   |
   | beyond the border of an NTSC television. PLEASE read "relnotes.txt" in |
   | the RARs to find out syntax for running the main features.             |
   | ALSO PLEASE NOTE THAT YOU MUST BURN THIS IN DISC JUGGLER 3.XX          |
   | DeXT's cdirip/cdi2nero should also work, but DJ2.xx will likely have   |
   | problems.  Hope you enjoy, this is by no means perfect but I get a     |
   | kick out of playing some oldies.                                       |
