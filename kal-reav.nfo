   |  A BLOODY GOOD TIME.                                                   |

   |  Cover up that neck 'cause five clans of vampires are out to get you!  |
   |  Loyal to their master, Kain, these bloodsuckers will do anything to   |
   |  protect him and his dynasty. As Raziel, you're determined to kill     |
   |  the evil master who created you. The realistic, beautifully gothic    |
   |  landscapes, made even more fantastic by the power of Sega Dreamcast,  |
   |  are riddled with mystery and danger. In Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver,  |
   |  the magic lands of ghastly ghouls are alive with instant karma as     |
   |  well! The nonplayer characters remember how you treat them and react  |
   |  accordingly, so watch out -- some horrors you bring on yourself.      |
   |  You will engage in death-defying, hand-to-hand combat, so make full   |
   |  use of the weapons and spells.                                        |
