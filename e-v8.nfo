    THE NEXT GENERATION OF AUTO COMBAT IS HERE! 

    Go back to the '70s to stop the Coyote terrorist gang from wreaking
    revenge on peace-loving America with their futuristic weapons and
    fully-loaded V8 vehicles. This gut-searing Sega Dreamcast title 
    will get you revved up with non-stop on-and off-road driving 
    combined with machine-gunning auto-combat action. Choose from 15 
    different vehicles, each with its own driving abilities and 
    weapons. Thrash your opponents with special attack moves and new 
    power-ups in fully destructible battle arenas. Increase vehicle 
    attributes as you play, and earn points towards the ultimate 
    vehicle upgrade that you can save and play against your cohorts. 
    Various modes provide a slew of single, two-player, and four-player 
    options. Get ready for the heaviest metal and rubber-burning brawl 
    of the century!

    - --- Group News --------------------------------------------------->

    And a new group breaks into the bustling Dreamcast scene. We had the 
    skills to do most things that KALISTO has done while they were doing 
    it, but hey, why bother if they're doing all releases already? Now 
    that KALISTO has stopped, we thought it would be a good time to 
    emerge and start releasing for the public. 

    We are not a bunch of newbies, actually most of us have several years
    of experience in the scene. We do ask that you leave us alone and we 
    will try to do our best for the DC scene. 

    We do not want to be contacted nor do we want any stupid rumors or 
    other shit started about us. Just keep in mind that we're doing this
    for free and not asking you to do anything in return except enjoy our
    work. We're here only to release games and have fun.
