In this          first-person adventure on Sega Dreamcast, you play as Maken          X, aka "Soul Sword." This powerful entity can "brain-jack,"          or take over, the minds and bodies of other characters.          Inhabiting a new body not only boosts your strength, but          also lets you access its unique powers. The ability to          manipulate a person's "psi," or soul, was discovered in a          research lab and promptly hidden in the Soul Sword.          Terrorists have kidnapped the chief scientist, and his          daughter Kay has awakened Maken X to assist her in rescuing          her father. As the quest continues, Maken and Kay go up          against a slew of disturbing, evil characters in real-time,          sword-slinging combat. As Maken, you definitely have the          sharper edge in this contest of wills. But you must rely on          skill and strategy to finish with all your limbs attached.          There are 7 different endings to this slasher, so your every          move will decide your ultimate fate.                                                                                                                         .                                                                 .   ___|---==같캢roup News같==------------------------------------------|___       |                                                                 |        Nothing to say about us, except:         1.
