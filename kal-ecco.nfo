   |  self-destruction, and win back his future. To do this, you must       |
   |  help Ecco recover the stolen dolphin-power that has been scattered    |
   |  throughout time and space. The bottlenosed dolphin travels through    |
   |  mysterious and breathtaking underwater worlds filled with puzzles,    |
   |  friends, foes, and danger. The graphics in Ecco are just astounding   |
   |  and have floored critics with their unprecedented beauty and sheer    |
