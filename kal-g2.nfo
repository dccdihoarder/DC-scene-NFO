   |  Please take note that this game was a packed and full GD-ROM which    |
   |  contained mostly needed game data. To make this rip even harder the   |
   |  movies that Game Arts encoded were done at a low bitrate to make them |
   |  fit on 1 GD-ROM. To make this release possible we had to convert all  |
   |  music and sound effects to Mono, and all FMV sequences had to be      |
   |  ripped out completely and replaced with a blank one. You will need an |
   |  80 Minute Blank to burn this release, Enjoy.                          |

   |  Amelia Earhart. Jimmy Hoffa. The Roanoke Colony. Grandia II. All      |
   |  vanished mysteriously, but only one has been found -- Game Arts       |
   |  recently re-announced its Dreamcast sequel to Grandia, after keeping  |
   |  the game completely under wraps for under a year. During that time,   |
   |  the game has undergone signifcant graphical improvements, but its     |
   |  core remains the same: an exceedingly happy journey through a         |
   |  brightly-colored world.                                               |
   |                                                                        |
   |  Like most RPG sequels, Grandia II takes part in a completely          |
   |  different world, which none too surprisingly played host to a         |
   |  cataclysmic battle between good and evil one thousand years ago. For  |
   |  once, evil won, and its gods assumed control of the world. Now, a     |
   |  new battle is set to begin, stemming from the continent of            |
   |  Granacliff. A massive ravine, likely a result of the ancient          |
   |  struggle, runs through the center of Granacliff. The adventure        |
   |  begins in the hero's home town of Shurisen, located on this           |
   |  continent.                                                            |
   |                                                                        |
   |  Four main characters have been announced so far: Rudo, a pragmatic    |
   |  monster hunter; Elena, an apprentice priestess ("Diva") at Granas     |
   |  church; Millenia, a mysterious magic-user; and Sky, an                |
   |  anthropomorphic, talking hawk. Yuushi Kanoe is designing the cast;    |
   |  Grandia's Noriyuki Iwadare is providing the musical score. (Iwadare   |
   |  is also responsible for the music in the Lunar games.)                |
   |                                                                        |
   |  Gameplay features are still very sketchy. The semi-real-time battle   |
   |  system of the original Grandia is confirmed as returning, though      |
   |  possibly in a modified form. Game Arts' original series of            |
   |  announcements concerning the game touted a two-player mode; whether   |
   |  this feature is still in the game is uncertain.                       |
   |                                                                        |
   |  Despite the lack of concrete facts on the gameplay, Grandia II is     |
   |  already shaping up to be a promising title. The graphics are          |
   |  outstanding, and the character designs seen thus far are appealing.   |
   |  UbiSoft has picked up the North American publication rights, and      |
   |  the game should be arriving in English December 8th, 2000.            |
