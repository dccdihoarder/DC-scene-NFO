        Yo! Check this.. this is the unreleased game halflife.
        Anyway.. you all know the story about this game so who
        gives a fuck about it.. 
        Well there was previous release of this which didnt
        work. You could not even burn it.. however here is
        a working release with vga box support and support for
        PAL and USA and JAP dcs.. works fine with all dcs!

        Rip Notes: Everything is still there, Audio downsampled.
                   Another perfect MUDS almost quality rip.
 
        Note: This was tested on a Japanese Dreamcast and works fine.
              This was tested on a PAL Dreamcast and works fine too!
        Use Disc Juggler 3.0 or later to burn this..
        And enjoy this fucking cool release...
