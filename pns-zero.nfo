   |  This game yelled for a fix so here it is. Enjoy.                      |
   |                                                                        |
   |  Yes we were the first NON-Release group (Not Utopia/Kalisto etc) to   |
   |  release patches for the Dreamcast. I dunno what you other people are  |
   |  smoking, anyways we arent any subset, any "shit" break off group or   |
   |  a daughter/sister group of any of the current release groups out so   |
   |  far no matter how cool or lame ass they are.                          |
   |  Ok lets get into it, Massive amounts of PAL Dreamcast users since the |
   |  day they imported have had mixed results with games either displaying |
   |  borders even though it was an NTSC game or some games running fine.   |
   |  Why? Well some games have code that checks your console and then will |
   |  output display depending on your console.                             |
   |  Finally we have answered your requests with these patches, no longer  |
   |  will PAL Dreamcast users have to suffer borders when they have an NTSC|
   |  compatable TV!                                                        |

   |  Patch Info :                                                          |

   |  Ok you need the Original ZERO BIN file which cannot have been         |
   |  modified or had a dummy added to it or this patch will not work!      |
   |  After it has been patched you can add a dummy or whatever you like.   |
   |  Oh and PLEASE get over your BIN fetishes, BIN this, gotta be BIN geez |
