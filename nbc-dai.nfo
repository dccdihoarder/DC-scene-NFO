 |    This is our second DC release, a very nice one might I add. Also, we have    |
 |    requested this release not to be posted on any public 'Release-News' web     |
 |    sites, due to the fact that they bring outsiders in this large enough 'scene'|
 |    and give the so-called 'legimate' press the wrong idea about what every other| 
 |    group and ourselves do.                                                      |
 |                                                                                 |
 |    Anyways this is our first GD Rip. Um, no sorry we can't get a full 1.2 gigs  |
 |    to fit tightly on an 74min, thanks. Instead we decided to ditch the in-game  |
 |    FMV which was useless anyway. If the screen goes black when the FMV is       |
 |    supposed to load, just press start and you'll be ok. Oh, sorry to the lamers |
 |    who don't have access to this game, but NO we DO NOT and NEVER will have a   |
 |    public IRC channel for you to request/bug people in. We would like to keep   |
 |    this DC 'scene' small enough to stay alive (AND THAT MEANS, YES, SUPPORT     |
 |    SEGA!) All you leeches that just suck from sega/associated developers and the|
 |    groups who are trying to make a positive impact on this 'scene' can go right |
 |    to hell, espically ones that call yourself legitimate writers and bash on    |
 |    piracy in a poorly written article, but then turn around and ask for/leech   |
 |    'iSOz'. You people are worse then the average EFNet leech, you are the CANCER|
 |    of our scene. Instead of playing a 'bootleg' Dead or Alive 2, maybe you ought|
 |    to take a class on journalism or re-think your career. (ahem-CNET-cough) :P  |                                        
 |                                                                                 |
 |    Anyways, enjoy the game..... / THE INCREDIBLE HULK, aka THE GREEN RAVER      |
