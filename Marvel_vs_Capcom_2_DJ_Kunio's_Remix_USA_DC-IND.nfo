This game is not self-boot. You will need to go to dcemulation and burn yourself a Utopia Boot disc. Minor annoyance, I know. But every method I tried has failed to produce a working disc. I wasted 30 CDs trying to make the game self-boot. I know I'll find a way eventually, though.

Enjoy the game!
