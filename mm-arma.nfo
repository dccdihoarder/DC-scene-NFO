   |  Note, The music had to be ripped out of this game to make it fit on   |
   |  any media. This game had a music track 68 Minutes Long, There was no  |
   |  other way to proceed than to rip this track. Anyway, The game without |
   |  music is pretty small and is still enjoyable.                         |
