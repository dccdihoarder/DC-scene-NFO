   |  Extreme Championship Wrestling -- replete with barbwire ropes and     |
   |  some pretty nasty-looking weapons of mass mayhem -- comes to Sega     |
   |  Dreamcast in the aptly titled ECW Hardcore Revolution. With 40        |
   |  different wrestlers to choose from (or you can create your own),      |
   |  each with their own unique fighting style and stock of bloodied       |
   |  props, this game promises to be for wrestling fans what caffeine is   |
   |  for game programmers: lifeblood. Also featured are three different    |
   |  venues, with over 20 different types of matches, including I Quit,    |
   |  Gauntlet, and the ever-popular First Blood. So come on down, and beat |
   |  your friend's head into virtual pulp!                                 |
   |                                                                        |
   |  - Hear! - the wrestlers use language that would make sailors blush!   |
   |  - See! - the referees run for cover!                                  |
   |  - Revel! - in gouts of blood spraying across the entire ring!         |
   |  - Play one of 40 professional wrestlers, or design your own.          |
   |  - Use a variety of "beater props": everything from kendo sticks to    |
   |    cheese graters.                                                     |
