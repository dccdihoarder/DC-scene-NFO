     |    Bust A Move 4 is the fourth in Taito colorful bubble-based                  |
     |    puzzle series. The game is sort of a reverse Tetris, with                   |
     |    colored bubbles building up at the top of the screen                        |
     |    (and steadily moving further down), with the point being to fire            |
     |    them up from the bottom to place matching colors together, thus             |
     |    making them disappear. The one player game puts you through a               |
     |    series of stages where the aim is to get rid of all the bubbles,            |
     |    while in the two player game, every time you clear a bunch, it              |
     |    sends some over to your opponent's side, and the goal is simply             |
     |    survival.                                                                   |
     |                                                                                |
     |    note: ignore the bug report from the inject tool. just press enter.         |
     |          it works fine                                                         |
