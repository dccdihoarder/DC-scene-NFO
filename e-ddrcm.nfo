     - --- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------> 
          
     This is the second DDR game for the Dreamcast. There are several
     modes including Arcade, Event, Endless, Training, and Edit. This
     version also features song from Beatmania as well.                
 
     - --- Group News --------------------------------------------------->
 
     And a new group breaks into the bustling Dreamcast scene. We had the 
     skills to do most things that KALISTO has done while they were doing 
     it, but hey, why bother if they're doing all releases already? Now 
     that KALISTO has stopped, we thought it would be a good time to 
     emerge and start releasing for the public. 
 
     We are not a bunch of newbies, actually most of us have several years
     of experience in the scene. We do ask that you leave us alone and we 
     will try to do our best for the DC scene. 
 
     We do not want to be contacted nor do we want any stupid rumors or 
     other shit started about us. Just keep in mind that we're doing this
     for free and not asking you to do anything in return except enjoy our
     work. We're here only to release games and have fun.
