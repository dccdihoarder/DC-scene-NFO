Title - Segagaga *repack* (Japanese)

Source - Private

Reason   - Hooligans/R18 SGGG and fixes freeze after around 15hrs of gameplay.
Reason 2 - Hooligans/R18 SGGG and fixes had AV needlessly removed.

Both issues fixed.

Repacked with permission for public release.

NOTE: This has been incorrectly reported as an Echelon release.  It is not.  It was assembled
with Echelon's selfbooting kit, and the ripper did not care to replace the header.
