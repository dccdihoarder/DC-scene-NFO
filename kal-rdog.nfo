   |  Note, This game auto-detects PAL & NTSC so it is playable on both.    |
   |                                                                        |
   |  The agreement between the Earth Council and the Haak Delegates came   |
   |  about, not through political or military means, but by financial      |
   |  measures. Three years after their mother-ship first orbited the       |
   |  earth the Haak were invited to the surface in peace and in the        |
   |  search for mutual rewards.                                            |
   |                                                                        |
   |  This agreement has been upheld for 7 years with only the occasional   |
   |  backlash causing small localised human / Haak conflict but the Haak   |
   |  have kept up their end of the bargain - until now!                    |
   |                                                                        |
   |  We have started to lose contact with the human installations around   |
   |  the Haak settlements. The first three recon. forces sent to           |
   |  investigate the disturbances were shot out of the air. The Red Dog    |
   |  Tactical Response Team is now preparing for war.                      |
   |                                                                        |
   |  As commander of the Red Dog assault vehicle, your job is to rid       |
   |  our people of the now aggressive Haak forces currently occupying      |
   |  the continents of planet earth.                                       |
   |                                                                        |
