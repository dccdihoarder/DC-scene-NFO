      all our releases take so long cause Dreamrip slow codings added.

Pork Ork Cherry Pie Recipe

after BBQ we bruhs like eat the cherry pie, Pork ORK like ice cream with pie!!
it make splendid dessert for any occassion!!

Ingredients for Cherry Pie:

Pastry for two 9-inch pies
1/3 cups sugar
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 16 ounce cans pitted
  red tart cherries, drained
1/4 teaspoon vanilla
2 tablespoons butter or
  margarine

Pork ORK he say u no use BBQ for make the pie!!
u must use the oven in kitchen!!


Heat oven to 425 degrees. Prepare pastry. Mix sugar, flour, cinnamon and nutmeg. Stir in cherries. Pour into pastry-lined pie plate; sprinkle with
vanilla. Dot with butter. Leave 1-inch overhang on lower crust. Roll second
pastry into circle for top crust; cut into strips about 1/2 inch wide.
(Use pastry wheel if desired.) Place 5 to 7 strips across filling. Weave a
cross-strip through center by first folding back every other strip going the
other way. Continue weaving lattice, folding back alternate strips each time
cross-strip is added. Fold trimmed edge of lower crust over ends of strips.
Build up a high edge; seal and flute. Bake until crust is brown and juice
begins to bubble, about 35 to 45 minutes.

Serve with our release and whatever beer happens to remain.
