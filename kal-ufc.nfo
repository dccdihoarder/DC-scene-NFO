   |  Ok, Back from our 16 hour break. Really funny to see most of you      |
   |  whiner's reactions.  Did you guys ever sit down and wonder which      |
   |  group has given you 95% of the DC releases out there?                 |
   |                                                                        |
   |  To those of you who think we're arrogant/childish, all I can say is   |
   |  put your money where your mouth is, and do something about it, or     |
   |  don't download any of our releases.  Simple as that.                  |
   |                                                                        |
   |  And to the people who can't get DJ working, do you really think we    |
   |  give a fuck about your shitty burner's problem?  Take what you can    |
   |  and if you dont like it, FUCK OFF and do it yourself.                 |
   |                                                                        |
   |  Never bite the hand that feeds you folks,  otherwise you'd be stuck   |
   |  playing lame NES emulators on your wonderful 128bit machines.  But    |
   |  its not all negative here, we'd like to say thanks to all our fans    |
   |  and supporters, and this game is dedicated to you.                    |
   |                                                                        |
   |  Crack Notes:                                                          |
   |                                                                        |
   |  The first copy protected DC game. Anchor put a 700MB file called      |
   |  Z700MB.ZZZ on this game and the game failed to run without it. Now    |
   |  that file has been renamed to Z000MB.ZZZ and thats the size it is.    |
   |                                                                        |
   |  A "real" dummy file has been added to this release already to speed   |
   |  up loading and it is also self-booting. (DiskJuggler fans rejoice!)   |
   |  Considering that the first stage of protection is defeated within the |
   |  next day of it coming out,  we really have to hope that Sega & it's   |
   |  developers can challenge us further in the weeks to come.             |
   |                                                                        |
