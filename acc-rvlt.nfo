 | All music has been ripped from this game FOR A REASON. Like Snow Surfers |
 | the music for this game is done with CDDA, not file-streamed audio. For  |
 | whatever reason, it is not possible for cracked DC games to playback     |
 | CDDA audio when using Utopia's Boot Loader v1.1. If CDDA playback        |
 | becomes available in the future you can expect updates from us!          |
