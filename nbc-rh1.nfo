 |  Step into the shoes of Taro Yamada (the Japanese equvilant to John Smith), an  | 
 |  average teenager living in a weird hybrid of 1990's suburbia and Japanese sub- |
 |  culture. Just a normal, average teenage life he was living, untill one day when|
 |  a pizza man delivers something other then pizza, a super-hero outfit. This out-|
 |  fit, powered by Sanyo(TM) batteries, gives you super-human powers. But when the|
 |  batteries run out.........                                                     |

 |  During many superhero quests, you can learn the ropes of becoming a true hero  |
 |  and also learn your limitations. Using the SECA CREAMCAST to check e-mail and  |
 |  new missions, Rent a Hero No. 1 is a must get. Japanese but FULLY PLAYABLE and |
 |  enjoyable. Have fun!                                                           |
