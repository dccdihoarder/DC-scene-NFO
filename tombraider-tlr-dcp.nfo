Game info:
THE EPIC CONTINUES... IN DREAMCAST TERRITORY.

In her latest adventure, the intrepid Lara Croft returns to her roots. She
journeys back into the tombs of ancient Egypt to face her arch-nemesis,
and also her past. Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation brings back the
original atmosphere, suspense, and puzzle-oriented gameplay that made the
series legendary. This time, Lara is equipped with all-new moves to face
the myriad of twisted traps, creepy enemies, and mind-bending puzzles that
try to stop her. As she ventures from temple to tomb, Sega Dreamcast's
128-bit 3D processing power creates lush, detailed worlds and super-smooth
animations that bring Egyptian myth and mystery to vivid digital life.
State-of-the-art graphics make Lara herself look more dazzling than ever
with a smoother character model and fluid, cinematic moves. This version
takes classic Tomb Raider to a stunning new level.
