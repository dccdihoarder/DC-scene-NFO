              Util for playing mp3's on your dreamcast... 

The MP3DC allows you to play MP3 CD's on your Dreamcast console! 
Create your own playlists and display the song and artist being played
Also did include free 100 track MP3 CD which was shite so isin't included.
Features include: 
         Easy to use - plays CD based MP3 files 
         Plays files of any size - plays VBR files 
         Includes CD and file browser 

The original disc's dummy was only 273mb, this was changed for a 620mb one
(making the entire CD just under 74 mins) - tho I doubt a dummy would really
be needed for something like this anyway. Also a SFV file is included on the
CD (for MP3.BIN) so you can check that it burned OK if you want to.

Note that some MP3s would cause our test DCs to lock up, whereas it were
fine with others - so don't blame us, blame your MP3s :)
