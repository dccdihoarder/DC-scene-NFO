    SURVIVE THE TERROR OF DINOSAUR ISLAND. 

    Strange events have happened on a small island off the coast of
    Mexico and set the stage for Blue Stinger, an inspired 
    action-thriller on Sega Dreamcast. The story unfolds in lush, 
    realistic, cinematic style and engulfs you in its dense
    storyline and non-stop action gameplay. Emergency rescue specialist 
    Eliot Ballade and his sidekicks need your help to unravel the dark 
    secrets behind the island's bioengineering research center and its 
    sinister experiments. Your mission will sharpen your wits with
    complex scenarios, plot twists, mini-adventures, surprise 
    encounters, and host of detective work to be done. Swim, crawl, 
    drive, jump, and blast your way through over 230 locations on the
    island, and battle a legion of hideous mutant creatures along the 
    way. You'll be awestruck by this meticulously designed world,
    mind-blowing explosions, and spectacular effects. Forget sci-fi 
    celluloid. Put yourself center stage.

    - --- Group News --------------------------------------------------->

    And a new group breaks into the bustling Dreamcast scene. We had the 
    skills to do most things that KALISTO has done while they were doing 
    it, but hey, why bother if they're doing all releases already? Now 
    that KALISTO has stopped, we thought it would be a good time to 
    emerge and start releasing for the public. 

    We are not a bunch of newbies, actually most of us have several years
    of experience in the scene. We do ask that you leave us alone and we 
    will try to do our best for the DC scene. 

    We do not want to be contacted nor do we want any stupid rumors or 
    other shit started about us. Just keep in mind that we're doing this
    for free and not asking you to do anything in return except enjoy our
    work. We're here only to release games and have fun.
