旼컴[ Release Notes ]컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

  Japanese Name : Silent Scope
  
  Game Info :
  
	Silent Scope made its debut in 1999 as an arcade gun shooting game.  
There is a scope in the installed rifle, and this scope takes you to the new 
world. You will enjoy the feeling of searching out the enemy, the feeling of 
peeping through, invigorating feeling of shooting down the enemy as a sniper 
in a single shot. It pioneered a new world of arcade-shooting experience 
which never existed before. In this console version, there is a newly added 
mode (Shooting Range) as well. For people who know only the arcade game, we 
sincerely wish you enjoy this console version with these new feelings.
