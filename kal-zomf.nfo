   |  Here's the 1ST_READ.BIN Fix for people who already downloaded the bad |
   |  release of Zombie Revenge. Extract all files from the original        |
   |  release, overwrite the 1ST_READ.BIN with the one included in this ZIP |
   |  and burn it off as a Mode1 disc in Nero or EZ CD Creator. If you are  |
   |  too stupid to do this, then download the repacked ISO which we are    |
   |  also putting out at the same time. Greetings to Flash Gordon for his  |
   |  excellent work on fixing this game.                                   |
   |                                                                        |
   |  BURY THE UNDEAD - FOREVER.                                            |

   |  It takes both firepower and fist-power to wipe out the ultimate army: |
   |  a legion of hideous killer Zombies that pack a gruesome punch. A      |
   |  top-secret government plan to turn the dead into a deadly fighting    |
   |  machine has fallen into sinister hands. You must lead a team of       |
   |  special agents and rescue a city under siege by this relentless       |
   |  force of "recyclable" soldiers. But how are you going to stop them    |
   |  if they're already dead? The monster arcade hit Zombie Revenge has    |
   |  invaded Sega Dreamcast with more action-packed gameplay than ever     |
   |  before. Strewn with branching paths, hidden areas, secret weapons,    |
   |  and shortcuts, each game becomes a new grisly adventure. Take the     |
   |  "un" out of "undead" as you beat these bio-engineered super-warriors, |
   |  and save the country from their horror.                               |
   |                                                                        |
