
It's basically a homebrew version of the Para Para Paradise games.  They took actual videos
from the Para Para Paradise series (1-4), made their own arrows, and made their own version
of the dance sensor that comes with it.  It's just another way to practice your para para dancing
at home before heading to the arcade to play or to a para para club (if you're lucky enough to live in
a country with one).  There are a few screenshots at www.lan-kwei.com, under the DC section -
I remember seeing a screenshot of Ryoko doing Velfarre 2000.
Also - the video and arrows tend to go out of synch into the second verse...it's not a bad rip, just how it is.
