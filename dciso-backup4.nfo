   |  This pack is made up of a bunch of files and tutorials that I have    |
   |  collected over the past year or so. This pack includes step by step   |
   |  instructions on how to use your Sega Broadband Adapter to read and    |
   |  make backups of you GD-ROMS. I have included all the images that      |
   |  you will need to connect your Dreamacast to your PC. I have also      |
   |  included all the tools that you need for downsampling and burning.    |
   |  I am not taking credit for the Ripping Tutorial cause Like I said it  |
   |  has been made from all the tutorials and info other people have done. |
   |  However I have added and updated parts of it, but for me to take all  |
   |  of the Credit would just be wrong. If you have any questions about    |
   |  this pack or how to make a backup of your original GD-ROM you can     |
   |  contact me on IRC-EFNET in #dcftp or by email at dCiSo@iscentral.org  |
   |                                                                        |

   |  Well I have added alot more stuff to this pack for those of you who   |
   |  use it to backup your dreamcast games. I have added about 10 or so    |
   |  new utils and also covered some other protections that are used on    |
   |  some of the GD-ROMS. The New Utils that are included in this pack     |
   |  are:                                                                  |
