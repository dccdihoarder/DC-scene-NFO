    A BEASTLY TALE OF MAGIC AND MAYHEM. 

    No one ever said marriage was easy -- especially not for the King 
    of Gomar. His wife, distraught over the death of her son, started 
    using black magic in a last-ditch effort to bring him back to 
    life. Together with her other son, Felies, they cast spells until 
    a suspicious mist crept over the land, turning the town's people
    into vicious beasts. These ravaging animals attack with a battle 
    cry that will make your hair stand up. There are five huge worlds 
    in Soul Fighter to battle in and the graphics and effects look 
    amazing on Sega Dreamcast. The King banishes his wife and son 
    from the kingdom, before they can do further damage, with the 
    help of three warriors. Atlus, the king's leading knight; Sayomi, 
    a female spy; and Orion, a wizard, must fight to restore order 
    to Gomar and save the innocent souls caught up in this beastly 
    mayhem.
