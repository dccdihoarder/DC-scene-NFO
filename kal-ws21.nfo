   |  Sega Sports hits a home run with another winning sports simulation    |
   |  for Sega Dreamcast. In World Series Baseball 2K1, you'll find the     |
   |  same immersive realism and hard-hitting gameplay that turned the      |
   |  other Sega Sports titles into game legends. Detailed player models    |
   |  and real MLB rosters for the 2000 season make you feel like you're    |
   |  down in the dugout with the big leagues. Today's hottest players are  |
   |  recreated in the game using real sports data and signature batting    |
   |  and pitching styles. Realistic injuries and seasonal weather also     |
   |  affect player performance, and you can track a batter's trends using  |
   |  hot/cold zones. Strategy is key to your team's success and in-depth   |
   |  pitching mechanics give you up to 32 pitches per player. If you're a  |
   |  wily coach, you'll use your VMU to choose pitches without your        |
   |  opponent's knowledge! So get in some spring training and get ready    |
   |  to take on the majors.                                                |
