     |  Yeaaaaah Team Drastic is back with another nice Release for you.  |
     |  Today we bring you Chicken Run *Multi5* PAL                       |
     |                                                                    |
     |  Chicken Run - the movie was a huge hit across the world and now's |
     |  your chance to re-live the Chicken Run  experience in a great new |
     |  game. In keeping with the film's story, the game is set on a      |
     |  1950s Yorkshire chicken farm in the north of England and follows  |
     |  a group of lovable chickens as they try to break out of their     | 
     |  confinement.                                                      |
     |  It is night and all seems quiet on Tweedys Farm. But someone - or |
     |  something - stirs in the shadows.... It is Ginger, a chicken with |
     |  a mission. She and her fellow flock are determined to escape the  |
     |  egg farm where any chicken who doesn't make her quota can meet a  |
     |  fowl fate.                                                        |
     |                                                                    |

     |  - Languages are German, English, France, Spain, Italian           | 
     |  - We ripped the Videos in the English, France, Spain and Italian  |
     |    folders, but the game seems to work... You must know that all   |    
     |    Videos in all language directories are exact the same. They     |
     |    are just there to fake the rippers. So the videos in the main   |
     |    dir also works for all 5 languages, and there's no need for 5   |
     |    times the same movies in 5 directories....                      |
     |                                                                    |
