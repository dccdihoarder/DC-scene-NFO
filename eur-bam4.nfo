   |    Bust A Move 4 is the fourth in Taito colorful bubble-based        |
   |    puzzle series. The game is sort of a reverse Tetris, with         |
   |    colored bubbles building up at the top of the screen              |
   |    (and steadily moving further down), with the point being to fire  |
   |    them up from the bottom to place matching colors together, thus   |
   |    making them disappear. The one player game puts you through a     |
   |    series of stages where the aim is to get rid of all the bubbles,  |
   |    while in the two player game, every time you clear a bunch, it    |
   |    sends some over to your opponent's side, and the goal is simply   |
   |    survival.                                                         |

   |    Load it up, fire it up but don't forget to cum on your gf!        |
