 |   This ELITE title was supplied of course by TOOL and HYSTiNX. DX Life is a     | 

 |   cool board game from KID similar to THE GAME OF LIFE here. By the way, this is|

 |   NOT a silver, unlike those lame un-original's that EURGAYSia has been putting |

 |   out. Thanks to TOOL for the TOKYO STORE FINAL.                                |

 |  The PIMP HYSTiNX bitch-slaps us with another hot JAP original, reminding us    |

 |  that he is the pimp and we are the 2-dollar hoes!                              |
