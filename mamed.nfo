The CD swap bug has been fixed. Turned out to be a single character in the KOS iso9660 driver (uint32 changed to int32) for those that want to know. So now you need my special version of KOS to run MAMED on your dreamcast, although this version should run any standard KOS application without problems. I've included the standard KOS boot script support in this special version so you can change which mamed.klf gets run of a CD or so you can run some kind of KOS menu application to select one. Disk swapping should not cause any problems, to refresh the screen just try and load something that's not on the disk by pressing start from the game list and it will rescan the CD correctly. You can download the plain files here. Just be sure to edit the boot.rc file to run the version of mamed.klf you want. I've also imbedded the stream.drv in the /rd inside KOS so you don't need it on the CD anymore.

OK now on to the MAMED packs. All cpu and sound drivers are inside in each pack so they will be too big to load onto /rd and run it from there so they must be on a CD to run preferably the CD with KOS above. All MAME drivers are included and separated by manufacture groups but not all will run because of memory constraints. I tried to make all the packs about the same size (~5MB). I can fairly easily make special builds to run a particular game with only the bare minimum of code but I will work on that later. Remember the uncompressed rom size is important but also each driver has to emulate ram chips inside the machine too so don't expect a rom that uncompresses to 14.6MB to run on the dreamcast you need space for ram chips and the emulator code and even then it might be just too slow. Also remember this is based on MAME v37b6 not the latest and some rom have changed.

These are big files so don't just go downloading all of them at once. Download one with the KOS above and give it a try first. Please let me know if they work, the last beta build was diffcult for most people. This one should be much easier to get working. I'll get around to packaging up the source when I get a chance and hopefully others can make some selfboot images, I'm no good at it with my CDR. Remember this is still beta and there will be problems running some games. Enjoy.
