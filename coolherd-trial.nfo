Late christmas present for the Ops at SegaPalace

HarmlessLion Games and TheGoatStore present: Cool Herders

This is the full version, but I'd like anybody who enjoys this nifty little pac-man battle
type game to cough up the $20.00 to own the real thing.  The package is high quality
and definately worth $20.00 IMO.  Remember to support those who support our dearly beloved
dreamcast.

Greetz to all the SP-Ops.
