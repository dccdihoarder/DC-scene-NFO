   |  AN ELECTRIFYING RACE.                                                 |
   |                                                                        |
   |  There's no track here -- no flags, no spectators. Re-Volt takes the   |
   |  racing genre and turns it upside-down by having you race at breakneck |
   |  speed through crazy places such as a supermarket, museum, garden,     |
   |  cruise ship, neighborhood, the Wild Wild West, and Toy World. These   |
   |  7 fun and wacky interactive environments are chock-full of eye candy. |
   |  Each of the 28 Re-Volt racers has a unique personality and a mind for |
   |  destruction. Two of the cars are brand new and 12 were made           |
   |  specifically for Sega Dreamcast. New gameplay and feature             |
   |  improvements are based on consumer feedback from the award winning    |
   |  PC version. There are tons of pick-ups, weapons, and surprises in     |
   |  this reward-as-you-go game. Track Editor lets you create and save     |
   |  your own tracks, and the graphics deliver the racing experience in    |
   |  128-bit glory.                                                        |
