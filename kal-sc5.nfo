   |  ~~~~~~~~~~                                                            |
   |  ULALA IS IN THE HOUSE                                                 |
   |                                                                        |
   |  When the Morolians invade, ace reporter Ulala scoops the story for    |
   |  Space Channel 5. The hip-hopping aliens zap citizens into a hypnotic  |
   |  dance trance, but beat girl Ulala is their ultimate match. So they    |
   |  challenge her to a dance battle, and she busts out her grooviest      |
   |  moves to free the captives. This funky dance title looks out of       |
   |  this world on Sega Dreamcast, with real-time rendered dancers and     |
   |  detailed, streaming backgrounds. Its retro-futuristic flavor adds     |
   |  even more cool to the technicolor visuals. As you tune in to the      |
   |  infectious beat, Space Channel 5's simple controls get you boogying   |
   |  along with the party. Get down with our supernova star as she struts  |
   |  through the space station in style!                                   |
   |                                                                        |
   |  - Stunning graphics with a retro-futuristic motif.                    |
   |  - Groovy soundtracks featuring a range of artists.                    |
   |  - 78 unique characters, complete with their own bios and galactic     |
   |    moves.                                                              |
   |  - Multiple hidden levels and miniquests for replay value.             |
   |  - Hip, eye-catching dance moves.                                      |
   |  - Controls remain simple though the beat becomes increasingly         |
   |    complex.                                                            |
   |  - Camera movements match up perfectly with the onscreen dance troupe. |
