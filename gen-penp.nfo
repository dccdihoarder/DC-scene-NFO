         Well some of the CDDA tracks has to be cutted to make the game 
         fit on a 80min cd. You큞l not notice that in the game and all 
         the tracks are there, not like the USA version of this game 
         which was released with some tracks killed. Well enjoy the 
         funny caracters :) in German, English, Frech, italian, Spanish 
         and Dutsch. That큦 all!!

          How it works:	   
         Fire up Discjuggler and burn the game like any other DC 
         game you큩e ever burned with DJ.  
      .                                                                 .

        The characters in Pen Pen TriIceLon are so likeable, you'll 
        want to keep them around as pets! This game on Sega Dreamcast 
        takes you through 4 beautiful courses filled with brightly-
        colored, detailed graphics. Whether you are belly sliding, 
        swimming or speed walking, you are always in a unique section 
        of the course. Meet the objectives and you move to the next 
        level. Once you make it to the expert mode, you race in an 
        entirely new section. The controls are solid and easy-to-manage, 
        so this is a great game for kids and novices. Another user-
        friendly aspect of this game is the on-screen instructions that 
        give tips on how to maneuver the controls, where to go, etc. 
        When you finish first in a race, you are awarded with gifts. 
        They don't enhance the race at all, but are a fun batch of 
        accessories to dress up your Pen Pen (Penguin in Japanese). 
        This game can be played with up to 4 players. 

         Game Features:
   
        - Four unique courses. 
        - Eight fun characters. 
        - Three cool environments: snow, ice, or lakes. 
        - Varying skill levels to choose from. 
        - Split-screen mode. 
        - Funny character comments and upbeat music to race by.
