    HOOP HOUNDS ABOUND. 

    It's show time! The NBA, NBC, and Midway team up to bring you this
    season's hottest basketball action on the Sega Dreamcast court. 
    Crossover dribble moves, no-look passes, rim-rocking dunks -- this 
    high-flying title will feature 145 brilliantly detailed, 
    motion-captured stars from all 29 NBA teams, including Rookies. 
    Build your own team with real or created players, and dive into 
    2-on-2 action in your favorite NBA arena, or take the game to one
    of several fantasy courts. Keep the game rolling with loads of 
    extras including hidden characters and courts, sweet spots on the 
    court, and On Fire mode. Up to four players can participate in the 
    fast-breaking frenzy at any one time. This game will slam and
    jam your mind with NBA history-making action.

    Rip Notes:

    This game had a CDDA track full of commentary which was about 74
    Minutes long. There is no way to fit the whole commentary track
    and game data onto 1 CD of 80 Minutes length. So, some of the
    commentary had to be cut off - Mostly player name announcements
    on the player select screen and some shot calls. This is the best
    possible for this title as of now, maybe if we weren't limited to
    80 Minutes we could have done a better job - But unfortunately
    that's just the way things are. Enjoy this rip, and if you like
    it, BUY IT.
    
    - --- Group News --------------------------------------------------->

    1) Notice to the public: #ECHELON on EFNet is not the official 
       Echelon channel, it is rather a channel of imitators. Do not 
       take anything they say to be related to ECHELON, Thanks.

    2) We generally don't do something like this, but we feel that it's
       in our best interest to let the public know the truth about
       the Maken X Self-Boot release:

       What is the point in stealing someone elses work and creating a 
       non-working image? Echelon is a group about quality and 
       releasing games that work 100%, in all levels (or at least we
       try to make it that way!) and we don't blatantly rape games. 
       If a game is unrippable, then it is unrippable, if a game is 
       unrippable to self-boot, then it is unrippable to self-boot.
       We won't rape it just to get a half-assed release out there. 
       Dchackers ripped NECESSARY files for completing Maken X no 
       matter what they may try to come up with for an excuse. Not to 
       mention that they stole another groups  endless hours of effort, 
       downsizing, reindexing, and rebuilding the custom commentary 
       file on it, and what do they give us in return? Name calling. 
       That is surely enough rambling about a group that doesn't even 
       deserve to be mentioned in of our NFO's, so we will leave it here.
