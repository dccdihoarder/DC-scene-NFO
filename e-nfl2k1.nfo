    - --- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------>

    Right before the end of millenium, ECHELON has cracked for your
    pleasure the games that all American's have been awaiting since
    the beginning of the Dreamcast scene! Yes baby! After 6 months
    of on and off work we give you NBA2K, NFL2K, NBA2K1, and NFL2K1. 
    We hope you all had a nice Christmas/Hanukkah/Kwanzaa, enjoy 
    these games before the start of the new millenium & year!

    Greetings to our friends at Kalisto Playstation for helping us 
    with the cracks! These releases would not be possible without 
    them, Thanks!

    The commentary and play by play announcing has been downsampled
    in this release and the intro FMV was ripped out completely.

    Also, please take note that this isn't your standard format for
    a self-booting image. Quite a few people may have problems
    burning these games. We have devised a few solutions for those
    that may have problems with DiscJuggler:

    A) Self-Boot Solution

    1. Run CDIRIP on the DiscJuggler image with the flags /iso and
       /full. 
  
    2. Goto CDRWIN's Tools Menu, Select Record ISO9660 Image. Choose
       the 1st Session as your ISO image, select the options:
       CDROM-XA, MODE2, Open New Session, Finalize Close/Session.
   
    3. Burn this session off at your desired speed.

    4. Goto CDRWIN's Tools Menu, Select Record ISO9660 Image. Choose
       the 2nd Session as your ISO image, select the options:
       CDROM-XA, MODE2, Finalize/Close Session.

    B) CD-Loader Solution

    1. Run CDIRIP on the DiscJuggler image with the flags /iso and
       /full.

    2. Goto CDRWIN's Tools Menu, Select Record ISO9660 Image, Choose
       the 1st Session as your ISO image, Select the options:
       CDROM, MODE1, and Finalize/Close Session.

    3. Burn it off and load up in your CD-Loader.

    Alternate method: Use CDmage and extract all files from the
    1st session, then master them with your favorite data mastering
    program as MODE1.

    Of course if you have a decent burner that fully supports
    DiscJuggler, you don't have to worry about any of the above, and
    you can just burn off the self-booting DiscJuggler image.

    Other Notes:

    - NFL 2K & NBA 2K do not work with RGB cables, the same problem
      is present on the original and we were unable to find a fix
      for it. If anyone else wants to fix these, be our guest.
      
    - NFL 2K1 & NBA 2K1 work fine on RGB cables, and all of these
      games work fine with a VGA Box.
 
    - NBA 2K1 & NFL 2K1 support online play through SegaNet and this
      feature has been tested in our releases.

    - Due to the audio being downsampled, you might want to goto the
      options menu and turn up the volume settings before starting
      a game.

    There can only be one! Many warriors tried and only one suceeded:

    E    -    C    -    H    -    E    -    L    -    O    -    N    !

    - --- Game Information And Features -------------------------------->

    YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT 'TIL SUNDAY. 

    No, this isn't just NFL 2K for the Internet -- this is a whole new 
    ballgame. NFL 2K1 is loaded with new features, and you can up the 
    stakes by playing pros around the country online through your Sega 
    Dreamcast. The players are tougher, faster, and stronger, while 
    improved AI makes for brutal defense. The running game is greatly 
    enhanced so you can run the ball and cover more ground. With more 
    animations, detailed players and stadiums, and more than 2,000 
    motion-captured moves, NFL 2K1 is an amazingly realistic experience. 
    And the realism extends beyond gameplay and into the NFL's business 
    side. Manage your favorite team in Franchise Mode with salary caps, 
    retirements, draft picks, and rookie signings. Thought you were 
    addicted to NFL 2K? Just wait. 

    Game Features:

    - For the first time ever, play against friends or foes via the 
      Internet -- up to eight players at a time. 

    - Totally revamped running game with addition of highly anticipated 
      juke move. 

    - Over 2,000 motion-captured animations and industry first 
      two-person tackle technology. 

    - All new "power move" leaves defense in the dust. 

    - Enhanced and richly detailed stadiums with awesome crowd and 
      sideline animations. 

    - Team playbooks mimic the real NFL books-no two teams will play 
      the same! 

    - Keep teams current by downloading updated player and team 
      attributes from the Internet. 

    - New and improved commentary that is more in-depth and situation
      specific. 

    - Smart VMU means saving only what you need to save-no more using 
      the whole VMU to save a game! 
 
    - Completely re-done, higher-resolution player models with their 
      actual accessories like wristbands-watch the light reflect in 
      their helmets!

    - --- Group News --------------------------------------------------->
 
    All the stupid speculators thought that these games were too big to
    fit on a normal CD. But it seems that they ALL fit on normal CDs
    and quite easily? Hmm, Maybe you dumbfucks shouldn't comment on 
    things until you can view things on GD-ROM's other than copyright
    text files. You're always wrong.
