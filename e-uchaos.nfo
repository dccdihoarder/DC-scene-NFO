    - --- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------>

    IMPORTANT NOTE: If you have a Japanese, Asian, or European Dreamcast
    you will have to get the Country Fix PPF from the E-UCHAOS.ZIP file
    which we are putting out aside this release. If you do not apply the
    PPF inside this ZIP, the game will not work on a Non-American DC.
    If you have a USA DC, you should be able to play this game fine
    without applying the PPF, but all others must apply the PPF or the
    game will not even boot. Also please note that this game has slow
    loading times, which are also present on the original.

    THESE COPS HAVE NO TIME TO KILL.

    The new millennium approaches. Turmoil, crime, and famine rule. 
    Gangs, terrorists and violent cults lurk around every corner. As one 
    of two cops, you must try and bring order to the city. D'arci is a 
    young and cunning super-sleuth with unsurpassed reconnaissance and
    infiltration skills. As Special Forces veteran, Roper is known for 
    his expertise in weapons and explosives. His skills are never 
    questioned, but his mental stability is.

    Either one could be the hero this city is waiting for.

    But time is running out...

    Game Features:
 
    - Choose from thirty different missions, each with multiple 
      branching sub-missions.
     
    - Explore the constantly shifting urban terrain. A street can be 
      filled with holiday shoppers the first time you pass, and a gang 
      fight the next.
     
    - Exploit multiple modes of combat and action, including 
      hand-to-hand fighting, shoot-outs, heavy weaponry attacks, and 
      vehicle chases.
                                                       
    - Meet forty unique characters.
                     
    - Explore a world with weather and time effects.
