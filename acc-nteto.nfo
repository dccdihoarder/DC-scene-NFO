 | Back to the R00ts, this time with audio! Smells like Silence b4 storm?
 | =========================================================================
 | You really can't go wrong with a great formula like Tetris. One of the   
 | best-selling games of all time now comes to you in its latest, most      
 | visually impressive form, The Next Tetris, Online Edition for the        
 | Dreamcast. Our preview copy revealed a very slick presentation, with an  
 | obvious high-tech, futuristic theme. Robotic arms and computer panels    
 | spring out to reveal your menu choices in a nicely done, not too garish  
 | way. Modes available include classic Tetris in single- and multiplayer   
 | modes, as well as TNT mode with online support for round-based head-to-  
 | head matches and two different marathon games. There's even access to a  
 | nifty practice mode if you feel the need to bone up on your MENSA        
 | training before you compete with the rest of the country.                
 |                                                                          
 | The graphics are clean and sharp, and they do well by not being          
 | overpowering or distracting. The window flips and turns that you feel    
 | after an opponent's multiline combo in TNT mode is suitably nauseating   
 | and fear-inducing. Some might be bothered by the slight tilt in the      
 | angle of the play screen. The colors are distinct, and the sound         
 | effects and voices of affirmation are passable, if a bit boring and      
 | unenthusiastic. We'll be anxiously awaiting the implementation of a      
 | soundtrack or background music of some sort.                             
 |                                                                          
 | With SegaNet up and running and with the success of NFL 2K1, TNT offers  
 | fans of puzzle-gaming an undoubtedly large base of opponents to play     
 | against. Apparently, strong network connections are sure to attract      
 | many competitive enthusiasts to the ranking system. You score a point    
 | by defeating an opponent in three rounds of a match; by winning matches  
 | not by filling your opponent's screen (as in classic Tetris) but by      
 | reaching the bottom layer; by ending the game; or by having the least    
 | rows before a two-minute time limit. This leads to fast and furious      
 | matches and quicker gratification than what you can find in other        
 | versions of the puzzler. You can also play TNT in marathon mode - the    
 | goal here is to survive as long as possible foiling your opponent's      
 | brick-breaking along the way. The player with the longest time gets the  
 | top ranking. The same goes for score marathon, the mode in which,        
 | instead of how fast you finish?, you are ranked for biggest combo and    
 | number of lines destroyed.                                               
 |                                                                          
 | We will be awaiting the release of The Next Tetris Online Edition to     
 | get a first-hand impression of how the SegaNet service works with the    
 | multiplayer aspect and whether the rankings are dealt with in as         
 | competitive and fun a way as possible. While the copy we have is far     
 | from completion, the potential for a really great game is here: Blue     
 | Planet did well to rely upon the timeless gameplay of Tetris without     
 | bogging it down with mindless effects and glitz.                         
 |                                                                          
 | Burning info:                                                            
 |                                                                          
 | We did not put this in standard Juggler format so that those that have   
 | Linux can still burn this.                                               
 |                                                                          
 | Steps to burn this:                                                      
 |                                                                          
 | CDRWIN Method (borrowed from ECHELON'S tutorial):                        
 | ------------------------------------------------                         
 | 1) Fire up CDRWIN                                                        
 | 2) Select Record Disc                                                    
 | 3) Click "Load Tracks", Click "Add" and select the CDDA directory's MP3  
 | files. Add them in order.                                                
 | 4) Click "OK" after the "Compiling Cue Sheet" box goes away, put a       
 | check in the box "Open New Session"                                      
 | 5) Click "Start Recording"                                               
 |                                                                          
 | When this is complete, click OK to dismissin the "Recording complete"    
 | box.                                                                     
 |                                                                          
 | 6) From CDRWIN's main menu, select the 2nd to the right button "File     
 | Backup & Tools"                                                          
 | 7) Backup/Tool operation - set this to "Record an ISO9660 Image File"    
 | 8) Select Tetris.iso in the image filename section                       
 | 9) Select CDROM-XA and Mode 2                                            
 | 10) Record.                                                              
 |                                                                          
 |                                                                          
 |                                                                          
 |                                                                          
 | CDRECORD Method (Mostly taken from EcHELON'S tutorial Kit):              
 | ----------------------------------------------------------               
 | 1) Decompress the MP3 files from .mp3 format to .wav format naming them  
 | track01.wav, track02.wav etc.                                            
 | 2) Now you should have a CDDA directory containing .wav files.           
 | 3) At a command prompt, run the command: cdrecord -scanbus               
 | 4) Next, run: cdrecord -dev=x,x,x -multi -audio speed=x                  
 | cdda\track01.wav cdda\track02.wav (etc...)                               
 | 5) When the above is finished, run: cdrecord -dev=x,x,x -xa1 speed=x     
 | tetris.iso                                                               
 |                                                                          
 |                                                                          
 | Long time no dc shit! be warned we arent sleeping we are working :)
