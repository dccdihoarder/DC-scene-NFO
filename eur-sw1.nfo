   |  We gave you Sakura Wars 2 last month, so its only fitting that we   |
   |  release the first game in this series. Enjoy!                       |
   |                                                                      |
   |  The Dreamcast version of Sakura Wars 1 is pretty much identical to  |
   |  the Saturn version. That's in some ways a good thing, as the Saturn |
   |  version was slick as could be on Sega's 32-bit system, but you'll   |
   |  still feel like your playing an old game.  Obvious improvements     |
   |  include no more dithering for the animated stills, super-clean full |
   |  motion video and beautiful highres artwork for the battle sequences |
   |  There's also VMU support in there with the game displaying an image |
   |  of the girl with whom you're interacting, allowing for a visual     |
   |  display of her reactions. That's really all there is to it, though, |
   |  so don't expect a whole new experience.                             |
   |                                                                      |
