                                 NOTES:

 Not much to say on this one. This is the PAL version of Sega's Arcade Game
                                GET BASS.

   Catch yourself some big fish. Best enjoyed with a Fishing Controller.

 This game is 100% intact, and comes complete with a dummy file already in
       the image. Without one, the loading times were quite severe.

  It has been cracked to work with the Utopia Boot Disc - the original was
                               protected.

      Greets to:  Utopia, Accession, Lightforce, High Society, Group 5
                          Anthrox, TRSI, Supplex

                  All the guys working in the DC scene
                   All dudes from the old amiga days!
