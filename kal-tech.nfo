   |  Today we bring you another quality title & rip. This time its Tech    |
   |  Romancer from Capcom ripped to perfection. This game had 1.2GB of     |
   |  data which was mostly custom formats. We had to downsample the audio  |
   |  to 22 KHZ and edit the EXE so it would adapt to that. Also all the    |
   |  FMV had its bitrate changed to make this monster fit. It now weighs   |
   |  in at 75 Minutes and an overburn is definitely possible. Enjoy        |
   |  another quality rip from your friends at KALISTO.                     |

   |  HEAVY METAL, JAPANESE-STYLE.                                          |
   |                                                                        |
   |  Put a high-tech robot through its paces in the fighting arena with    |
   |  Capcom's Tech Romancer for Sega Dreamcast. Eight different giant      |
   |  robots, each with their own pilots, histories, and modes of attack,   |
   |  can be piloted through arenas that are fully interactive. Power-ups   |
   |  can be discovered by destroying portions of the arena, but can also   |
   |  be lost if a powerful enough attack is made against your robot. The   |
   |  arenas are fully 3D, and a shifting landscape and camera angle helps  |
   |  pull you into the immersive environment. Damage and armor must be     |
   |  carefully managed, and knowing your 'bot's abilities can help you     |
   |  overcome even the most ruthless enemies.                              |
   |                                                                        |
   |  - Eight different robots, each with its own pilot or piloting team.   |
   |  - Multiple 3D arenas to fight in, on, and around.                     |
   |  - Smash arena obstacles to uncover hidden power-ups.                  |
   |  - Careful! A strong enough blow from your opponent can knock          |
   |    power-ups loose!                                                    |
   |  - Fly, roll, jump, walk and spin as you try to beat back the          |
   |    onslaught.                                                          |
   |  - Cinematic cut-scenes help you get to know the pilots and robots.    |
   |                                                                        |
