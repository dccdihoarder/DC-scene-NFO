 | KEPM was released for the Japanese Dreamcast (DC) 8/5/99, |
 | and retails for 3800 yen. It is played on 1 GD ROM disk   |
 | and uses 20 Blocks of memory.  KEPM is a "sequel" to the  |
 | DC game Kita e.  White Illumination (KEWI).               |
 | Its not really a sequel, but an Illustration Collection   |
 | with mini adventure.  It could be classified as an OMAKE  |
 | disk.                                                     |
 |                                                           |
 | KEPM takes place six months after the White Illumination  |
 | Countdown from KEWI.  You resume your role as yourself,   |
 | and you "Kita e" to Hokkaido during your summer vacation  |
 | to visit with your girlfriend for five short days.        |
 | Your goal this time is to create a new Album of Photo     |
 | Memories of your girlfriend.                              |
 |                                                           |
 | Enjoy it                                                  |

 | - --- Ripping Notes ------------------------------------> |
 |                                                           |
 | This is our *PROPER* rip for this game. We don't have the |
 | original GDROM. This is the Story:                        |
 | Someone gave us the SoulDC release of the game; the rar   |
 | files had problems, anyway the crc control for each files |
 | was right. After two bad burned cd, we tried to test with |
 | more care the cdi file. The error happened every time     |
 | that DiscJuggler 4.0 try to write the TOC (after the 12   |
 | track).                                                   |
 | So, after extract all the data and the cdda tracks, we fix|
 | all the *.bin, changed the LBA before the track nr. 12    |
 | (62393) we burned the game in a new cd.                   |
 |                                                           |
 | *NOTE: Thanks to SoulDC that ripped the game from GDROM.* |
 | *We think that SoulDC ripped 9 audio tracks, we will do * |
 | *the possible to find them in future.                   * |
 | *Also, use our release only if you have problem to burn * |
 | *the SoulDC rel. We think that our problem was use a DJ4* |
 | *4.01.986-Pro2 instead the PRO version.                 * |
 |                                                           |

 | Not much to say, holidays are ending. Anyway we are happy |
 | to play this game fixed, it was long time that we were    |
 | searching the original GDROM or a data iso.               |
