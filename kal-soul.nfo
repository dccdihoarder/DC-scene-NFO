   |  We brought you one of the best Playstation games of 1999 in LOK:SR,   |
   |  and now we are proud to present you the Dreamcast port of this game.  |
   |                                                                        |
   |  Also a note to the people of the so called 'legitimate press':        |
   |                                                                        |
   |  Please take a moment and look at yourselves before you go on your     |
   |  writing campaigns against piracy. I am 100% absolutely positive that  |
   |  you fuckers have and take part of our so called 'scene'. Yes, you     |
   |  folks are even worse than the typical pirate, at least the scene      |
   |  doesn't deny its roots.                                               |
   |                                                                        |

   |  A BLOODY GOOD TIME.                                                   |
   |                                                                        |
   |  Cover up that neck 'cause five clans of vampires are out to get you!  |
   |  Loyal to their master, Kain, these bloodsuckers will do anything to   |
   |  protect him and his dynasty. As Raziel, you're determined to kill     |
   |  the evil master who created you. The realistic, beautifully gothic    |
   |  landscapes, made even more fantastic by the power of Sega Dreamcast,  |
   |  are riddled with mystery and danger. In Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver,  |
   |  the magic lands of ghastly ghouls are alive with instant karma as     |
   |  well! The nonplayer characters remember how you treat them and react  |
   |  accordingly, so watch out -- some horrors you bring on yourself.      |
   |  You will engage in death-defying, hand-to-hand combat, so make full   |
   |  use of the weapons and spells.                                        |
   |                                                                        |
