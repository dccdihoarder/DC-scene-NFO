    Mortal Kombat's classic slug-fest is back -- and you've never seen 
    it look so good. This solid gold Sega Dreamcast title is the most 
    dazzling incarnation to date of the smash hit arcade series.
    Faster than a speeding fist at 60 frames-per-second, this version 
    features all new, fully rendered intro and endings. Go toe-to-toe 
    with some of the most evil characters ever created in more than 10 
    impressive new 3D arenas. But don't stop to look at the scenery.
    MK Gold 's lightning-fast gameplay makes each fighter's signature 
    moves smoother than ever, and lets you deliver that death blow in 
    multiple ways. Choose from 20 characters, including several classic 
    fighters that have returned for their 3D debut. The power of 
    Dreamcast is now in the hands of mere mortals -- brawlers beware. 

    Game Features:

    - 20 total controllable characters.
                                               
    - Old-version characters return in 3D: Cyrax, Mileena, Kitana, 
      Baraka, and Kung Lao.
      
    - More than 10 interactive fighting arenas with multiple game 
      fight modes.
                    
    - Several fatalities for each character.
          
    - Brand-new weapons select screen.
       
    - Fully rendered intro and endings.
                 
    - Sega Dreamcast Exclusive!

    - --- Group News --------------------------------------------------->

    And a new group breaks into the bustling Dreamcast scene. We had the 
    skills to do most things that KALISTO has done while they were doing 
    it, but hey, why bother if they're doing all releases already? Now 
    that KALISTO has stopped, we thought it would be a good time to 
    emerge and start releasing for the public. 

    We are not a bunch of newbies, actually most of us have several years
    of experience in the scene. We do ask that you leave us alone and we 
    will try to do our best for the DC scene. 

    We do not want to be contacted nor do we want any stupid rumors or 
    other shit started about us. Just keep in mind that we're doing this
    for free and not asking you to do anything in return except enjoy our
    work. We're here only to release games and have fun.
