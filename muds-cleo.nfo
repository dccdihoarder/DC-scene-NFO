     < ----------------------------------------------- Notes ---------- >  

          After some nice GBA Trainers from our girls at MUGS we are 
          back with a nice DC release. Its Cleopatra´s fortune from 
          Taito. This is a fucking cool puzzle game to keep you busy on 
          rainy days.. (wanking does the same tho!) 
 
          Note: This was tested on a Japanese Dreamcast and works fine.
                This has some evil protection sheme and wont work on PAL
                machines if you dont use an RGB Cable.. else its just 
                fine and you dont have to worry about anything..

          Use Disc Juggler 2.0 or later to burn this..
          And enjoy this fucking cool release...
 
          Shouts to Kojiro for this fine ripping and cracking-job.
