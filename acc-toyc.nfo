 | =========================================================================|

 | in "Toy Commander," an innovative action game for Sega Dreamcast. "Toy   |
 | Commander" is an exciting new 3D video game created by No Cliche where   |

 |                                                                          |
 | Special Features                                                         |
 | * Realistic and fully explorable 3D environments.                        |
 | * More than 50 hours of gameplay laid out in over 40 missions.           |

 | SPECIAL NOTE:                                                            |
 | All music has been ripped from this game FOR A REASON. Like Snow Surfers |
 | the music for this game is done with CDDA, not file-streamed audio. For  |
 | whatever reason, it is not possible for cracked DC games to playback     |
 | CDDA audio when using Utopia's Boot Loader v1.1. If CDDA playback        |
 | becomes available in the future you can expect updates from us! And a    |
 | message to those who scream that other releases have CDDA. Listen, "This |
 | is a Dreamcast disc..." ;)                                               |
