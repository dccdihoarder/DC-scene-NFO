   |              Don't ask me. It's a miracle I had that idea about      |
   |              using my toaster combined with the modded ps2 and       |
   |              the old magicom from the garage.                        |
   |              HuH?!? As you can see it was a deadly combo!            |
   |                                                                      |

   |    It's a tank sim, plain and simple, with supposed authenticity     |
   |    and battles taken straight from the annals of our nation's        |
   |    "Good War". But here's a nice catch... you can man a tank for     |
   |    any country you like.                                             |
   |                                                                      |
   |    Yes, ASCII has eschewed any sense of moral judgment and decided   |
   |    that tank selection is more important than instilling any kind    |
   |    of retro-patriotism, and I heartily agree with them. I mean, we   |
   |    all know that those German tank drivers were motivated by a       |
   |    decidedly suspect ideology, hatched from the skull of an Austrian |
   |    madman, but why should that keep me from knowing what its like to |
   |    pilot their sweet, German-crafted hardware? You can choose tanks  |
   |    from the UK, Germany, Russia, and of course the good old U. S.,   |
   |    all rendered to look and behave like their historic counterparts. |
