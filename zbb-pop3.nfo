Here is the only unreleased append disc for my
favourite Dreamcast series. Trouble with append 
discs is you cannot even play an original on a 
non-jap console - I had to rip it just to be 
able to play it ;)

Anyway, this release is useless unless you 
already have Pop'n Music 2 (GD-ROM or Eurasia 
release - either is fine). Just start Pop'n 
Music 2 and select 'Change Disc', then choose 
'Yes' and insert this CD. 

This release is already patched to work with 
RGB/Scart leads - keeping the PAL owners happy.
Note: Credit goes to Echelon for their Pop'n
Music 4 RGB fix, I used the same fix for this 
game.

Greets (In no particular order):
  KEL_, Lrd[EFN], titney, funfrock, Peitschi, 
  Jarvik7, sheepz, Turbohat, ace, clem,
  All the console groups - especially those
  still supporting handhelds, keep up the 
  good work.
  I'm sure I forgot a few people - so 
  Sorry to them :\

                   ENJOY!
