Descrition:

    None needed, you all know this kickass game. :)

Notes:

    Finally this is released with CDDA! You may be thinking "wasn't this
released already?", the answer is NO. Someone released it with "dummy tracks"
for reasons way beyond me. A little bit of work had to go into this, but what
release doesnt require work? Anyways, CDDA works great unlike so many other
releases I have seen lately. If you've never played this game give it a shot,
it's great. By the way, the music in this game is actually pretty cool, so
enjoy it and have fun with this release.

Group News:

    Im not a group! Thanks for all your support with the last release of
Carrier. To bad there are always those people who are pricks. Anyways, i tried
to follow up with Draconus... unfortunetly my big mouth fucked that up for me,
resulting in Echelon beating me to it. I've discovered not to tell everyone
what your working on, and especially not to tell everyone exactly how to fix
the particular game you are working on. Oh well, thats the way it goes in this
game. :) Hopefully I won't get beat with this one, lol. Hope for more releases
from me, but don't expect them (that's what i'm doing). ;)
