   |  Since the bootdisk came out, 1 group has broken through making all    |
   |  major developments on the Dreamcast Piracy front, We were the first   |
   |  to do games over 700MB in size, the first group to make territory and |
   |  RGB fixes, the first group to do WinCE games, the first group to make |
   |  CD-DA play in games, and the first group to start packaging CD-DA     |
   |  tracks into MP3 format. So, who would you expect to make the next big |
   |  breakthrough on the DC?                                               |
   |                                                                        |
   |  We've lived with the limitations of the loader for a while and got    |
   |  around them, but no longer do we have to, today we present you the    |
   |  first SELF BOOTABLE game for your Dreamcast.                          |
   |                                                                        |
   |  Kiss that loader CD goodbye, as once again other groups will have to  |
   |  adapt to our high standards. Expect some breaking developments about  |
   |  self-booting games within the next few days and keep your eyes peeled |
   |  for more.                                                             |
