   |  you fuckers have and take part of our so called 'scene'. Yes, you     |
   |  folks are even worse than the typical pirate, at least the scene      |
   |  doesn't deny its roots.                                               |

   |  UNSCRAMBLE THE MYSTERY!                                               |
   |                                                                        |
   |  In this sci-fi thriller, a team of archeologists is picking through   |
   |  the ruins of the ancient city of Fogna when they discover the         |
   |  Sleeping Man. He is encased in the cockpit of an egg-shaped machine   |
   |  that comes to be known as Elemental Gimmick Gear (EGG). The machines  |
   |  are duplicated and mass-produced for military and civilian use, but   |
   |  something goes terribly wrong! A sudden disaster destroys the city    |
   |  and awakens the Sleeping Man. He leaves the laboratory where he's     |
   |  slept for 100 years and ventures out into Fogna to try to piece       |
   |  together what happened. Travel across colorful terrain, made even     |
   |  more bright and beautiful by Sega Dreamcast. The hand-drawn lands     |
   |  are detailed and full of Sprites waiting to attack. Your biggest      |
   |  challenge will come in the dungeons, where you will come up against   |
   |  gigantic bosses. Attack with a punch or spin or simply teleport right |
   |  out of there! The enemies get stronger as you defeat bosses. Maybe    |
   |  you can solve the mystery of this mind-boggling disaster.             |
   |                                                                        |
