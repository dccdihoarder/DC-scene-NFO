Description :
=============

The story of Shenmue, which begins in 1986, centers on a young man named 
Ryo Hazuki. Ryo returns home one day just in time to witness his father's 
killing at the hands of a man named Lan Di. Both Lan Di and Ryo's father, 
Iwao Hazuki, are martial arts experts, but Iwao is no match for Lan Di's 
abilities. Lan Di enigmatically asks for "the mirror," and Iwao, unable to 
feign ignorance, reveals that it is buried underneath his sakura tree. Land 
Di finds the mirror and examines the decoration of a dragon, after killing 
Iwao. Ryo feels the need to avenge his father's death, even though he has no 
idea who Lan Di is or why his father was killed.

Ryo's first clue is a car that some of his neighbors saw on the day of the murder.
 Though his leads are few and far between, Ryo slowly makes progress in his investigation 
by interviewing people all over Yokosuka. Just as he is about to run out of leads, a letter 
from a man named Yuanda Zhu suggests that he seek the aid of a certain Master Chen, who works 
at the harbor. Through Chen and his son Guizhang, Ryo learns that a local wharf gang known as 
the Mad Angels is connected to Lan Di's crime organization, the Chiyoumen. Ryo also learns that 
"the mirror" stolen by Lan Di is part of a set of two mirrors. After much investigation, he 
locates the second mirror underneath his father's dojo. This mirror is decorated with a phoenix.

Ryo takes a job on the waterfront in order to learn more about the Mad Angels gang, and eventually
he causes them enough trouble that the gang kidnaps his friend (and principle love interest) Nozomi 
Harasaki. To rescue Nozomi, Ryo must first fight Guizhang, then team up with Guizhang to defeat all 
seventy members of the Mad Angels gang. Upon defeat, the gang's leader reveals to Ryo that Lan Di has 
left Japan for Hong Kong. With the aid of the Chen family as well as his family and friends, Ryo boards 
a boat to Hong Kong. Before the close of the first chapter (and subsequent end of the game itself), he 
is instructed by Master Chen to seek out the help of a master of the Chinese martial arts located in Wan 
Chai named Lishao Tao. Concluding the first chapter of Shenmue, Ryo boards a boat and travels to Hong Kong
in pursuit of Lan Di.
