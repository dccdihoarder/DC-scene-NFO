   |  Here's another re-release of a game that ACC raped previously.        |
   |  We recommend using an 80 Minute Blank. Unrar the game and you will    |
   |  get the BIN, CUE, and UNPACK.EXE. Run UNPACK.EXE to unpack the audio  |
   |  tracks, then load the CUE into CDRWIN as normal.                      |
   |                                                                        |

   |  BE NICE TO YOUR TOYS, OR THEY MAY SEEK REVENGE.                       |
   |                                                                        |
   |  It's an all-out war of the toys, and no room is safe in Toy Commander | 
   |  on Sega Dreamcast. Childhood toys come to life and fight for          |
   |  supremacy on the action-packed battlefield of a young boy's home.     |
   |  Andy's old-fashioned, toddler toys are fighting mad and not gonna     |
   |  stand for any more neglect. So they rise up and rebel against the     |
   |  shiny new generation of action toys, which you command to defend the  |
   |  playroom turf. But look out -- your enemy may seem cute and cuddly,   |
   |  but they're heavily armed and stone-cold deadly. With more than 50    |
   |  hours of mission-oriented gameplay, you'll control a battalion of     |
   |  air and land assault toys as you clash on the kitchen table, under    |
   |  the bed, or in other rebel-held territories throughout the house.     |
   |  This is not your average fun and games.                               |
   |                                                                        |
   |  - Total immersion in realistic and fully explorable 3D environments.  |
   |  - Interact with all objects in the room.                              |
   |  - More than 50 hours of gameplay.                                     |
   |  - Three different playing modes, two types of gameplay.               |
   |  - Split screen capability allows action for up to four players.       |
   |  - Eight battle arenas in the house, with up to two rooms each.        |
   |  - 35 vehicles to alternate and control, with multiple functions and   |
   |    weapons per vehicle.                                                |
   |  - Players combat a wide variety of enemies, ranging from toys to      |
   |    household items.                                                    |
