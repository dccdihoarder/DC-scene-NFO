	All people claimed that a standard PC/Cdrom can read a GD, that its
	very very true. But these people also claimed that they cant rip 
	100% a GD, because they only have a 80 min. TOC. We use this TOC 
	since August 2000, it make us rip a lot of games :)
	This CloneCD image is dedicated to all people of forums, that it
	say can rip some of GD but any people believe it :)
	If you dont know how to rip with this TOC, plz learn it w/o help,
	or you became a little lammer child.

	Note: This image have the same structure of a GD, if you want read
	the TOC of High Density with My PC and Isobuster.
