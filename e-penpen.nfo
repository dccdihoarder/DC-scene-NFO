    would fit on an 80 Minute Blank.

    THE CUTEST RACE EVER!

    The characters in Pen Pen TriIceLon are so likeable, you'll want to 
    keep them around as pets! This game on Sega Dreamcast takes you 
    through 4 beautiful courses filled with brightly-colored, 
    detailed graphics. Whether you are belly sliding, swimming or 
    speed walking, you are always in a unique section of the course. 
    Meet the objectives and you move to the next level. Once you make
    it to the expert mode, you race in an entirely new section. The 
    controls are solid and easy-to-manage, so this is a great game 
    for kids and novices. Another user-friendly aspect of this game 
    is the on-screen instructions that give tips on how to maneuver 
    the controls, where to go, etc. When you finish first in a race,
    you are awarded with gifts. They don't enhance the race at all, 
    but are a fun batch of accessories to dress up your Pen Pen 
    (Penguin in Japanese). This game can be played with up to 4 
    players.
