   |  Supposedly 'Our reign is over'.. A very reliable source has told me   |
   |  that ttol loves to kiss ass.                                          |
   |                                                                        |
   |  Today we bring you one of the best games of the year for your DC.     |
   |  This game was 90 Minutes Long, Which means generally we would have to |
   |  rip something out. However, we decided not to, and to give you the    |
   |  whole game. How? We've downsampled all of the music to a Mono, And    |
   |  it's hardly noticable on this game too. The main thing is that the    |
   |  whole game is intact, We found that this was the best way to do it,   |
   |  even though it took some extra work. If and when 99 Minute CD's are   |
   |  released, you can expect a Full Stereo Sound Addon for this game and  |
   |  instructions on how to use it. Until then, Enjoy the best possible    |
   |  rip of Jet Set Radio that fits on a 74 Minute Disc.                   |
   |                                                                        |
   |  When others talk shit about us, it definitely hits you back hard. So  |
   |  So nice try Accession & Ttol, But we definitely do know how to rip    |
   |  games that over 80 mins, and how to do it properly. :)                |
   |                                                                        |

   |  alive in 3D on Sega Dreamcast. Uniqueness is key to these kids and    |

   |  time to impress. It's fast, it's fun, and it's definitely funky.      |
