|      Hanagumi Taisen Columns 2 is a beautiful combination of the      |
|      famous Sakura Taisen anime with Sega's famous Columns series.    |
|      This game was titled a "Dramatic Puzzle" for a good reason~      |
|      During the story mode, you must choose one of the 8 famous       |
|      Sakura Taisen characters and battle your way to the lead role    |
|      in a popular stage production. Unfortunately, if you lose, you   |
|      will have to take the lesser-role of such things as a post       |
|      (mail box) or a motorcycle. (^o^) This game is also compatible   |
|      online, so you can battle your friends around Japan! (note:      |
|      the online features are only available in Japan, as this title   |
|      makes use of specialized dial-in servers which are located       |
|      around Japan.) There are MANY secrets to unlock in this game,    | 
|      including secret characters, side plots, character art, and      |
|      videos~! There is also a two player mode, where you and a        |
|      friend can choose your favorite Sakura Taisen character and      |
|      battle to columns victory. You can also chose from an variety    |
|      of different "skills" when choosing your character, such as      |
|      strength and defense. The visuals in this game are very nice,    |
|      from the anime stills and motion to the sparkling jewels that    |
|      you must align. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the     |
|      columns puzzle games, you must connect 3 or more of the same     |
|      jewel (vertical, horizontal, or diagonal) in order to make       |
|      them disappear as more and more jewels fall from the top of      |
|      the screen. If you get "chains" (getting rid of different jem    |
|      chains one after the other), your points will increase           |
|      substantially, and you will send black pieces to quickly fill    |
|      your opponents screen! It's a fast paced game requiring a lot    |
|      of concentration, and sometimes a lot of luck! Have fun with     |
|      this release~ it should definitely be in everyones' Japanese     |
|      Dreamcast collection~ (^c^)v                                     |
