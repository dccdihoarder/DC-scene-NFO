   |  Since the bootdisk came out, 1 group has broken through making all    |
   |  major developments on the Dreamcast Piracy front, We were the first   |
   |  to do games over 700MB in size, the first group to make territory and |
   |  RGB fixes, the first group to do WinCE games, the first group to make |
   |  CD-DA play in games, and the first group to start packaging CD-DA     |
   |  tracks into MP3 format. So, who would you expect to make the next big |
   |  breakthrough on the DC?                                               |
   |                                                                        |
   |  We've lived with the limitations of the loader for a while and got    |
   |  around them, but no longer do we have to, today we present you the    |
   |  first SELF BOOTABLE game for your Dreamcast.                          |
   |                                                                        |
   |  Kiss that loader CD goodbye, as once again other groups will have to  |
   |  adapt to our high standards. Expect some breaking developments about  |
   |  self-booting games within the next few days and keep your eyes peeled |
   |  for more.                                                             |

   |  Look out -- Wham! Bam! And a full-body Slam! This Sega Dreamcast      |
   |  version of Sega's revolutionary fighting game packs a one-two-three   |
   |  punch. As one of 12 fierce characters, you have a single deadly       |
   |  goal: to kick some 3D ass 'til you win the World Fighting             |
   |  Tournament. Incredible 3D environments, fluid gameplay, and lifelike  |
   |  graphics enhance the smooth fighting moves you're used to in the      |
   |  mega-hit arcade original. An exclusive feature of the Dreamcast       |
   |  version is Team Battle Mode, in which your custom three-person team   |
   |  goes head to head with an opponent's custom team. The fight is so     |
   |  realistic that characters actually watch their opponents' every       |
   |  life-like move, like when they fall forward from behind or lose       |
   |  their balance when pushed. Focus your razor-sharp reflexes and take   |
   |  lethal aim as you deliver bone-crunching blows to your reeling        |
   |  opponents. When the dust settles, you'll still be standing.           |
   |                                                                        |
   |  - All new Team Battle mode.                                           |
   |  - 13 fighting stages in full 3D.                                      |
   |  - Elevation and positioning dramatically change fighting strategy.    |
   |  - 12 classic characters plus two all-new characters.                  |
   |  - Stunning attention to detail--clothes ripple, eyes track opponents. |
   |  - Multiple camera angles including first person viewpoint.            |
   |  - Highly sophisticated fighting engine for incredible depth.          |
   |                                                                        |
