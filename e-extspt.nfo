      `- Proudly Presents:

      Game.....: Sega Extreme Sports (C) Sega / Innerloop

      Origin...: EUROPE - PAL/NTSC    -  Filename.....: E-EXTSPT.001
      Released.: October 14th, 2000   -  Format.......: DiscJuggler (CDI)
      Platform.: Sega Dreamcast (DC)  -  CD(s)........: 1
      CD1 Info.: 32 RARS / 80 MINS    -  Ripped.......: Some CDDA
    
    - --- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------>

    This game had a brand new protection scheme, the first one that
    Sega themselves have actually made. Due to this, you must burn this
    CDI with DiscJuggler ONLY, you can not use CDIRIP or extract the
    files through other methods and rebuild the ISO. You MUST burn this
    image with DiscJuggler V2.X or the game will not work. Also take
    note that some CDDA got ripped, and the remaining CDDA was relinked
    to other tracks that are still remaining on the disc.

    - --- Game Features And Information -------------------------------->
 
    Whoa, dude! Put on some baggy trousers and cut your hair in a
    ridiculous style - its time to get stoked.

    CONCEPT

    Extreme-type sports have been a popular subject matter for games in
    recent times, and Sega naturally wanted to go one better than the
    competition and combine some of the most extreme pastimes into one
    extreme package.

    EVENTS

    Cunningly, these can be played separately or as a kind of relay race
    in which you swap between modes of transport at checkpoints,
    hammering the A button, Track and Field-style, to sprint faster
    between them.

    - Snowboarding: Naturally theres a game based around this favorite
      hobby of trust-funded twentysomethings who dont have to have 
      proper careers. Steer your person down the icy slopes, pulling off
      daftly named tricks like the Japan Air and Stalefish. Rails for
      grinding upon stylishly appear every so often, but its best to
      rely on raw speed.

    - Hang Gliding: Float like a feather on the air, then slam into the
      ground and earn yourself some compound fractures. This event
      begins with your glider being toward spasmodically by a plain
      until you press the red buton to release. Ramming the blue
      balloons slows you down bu scarlet ones add more velocity. You can
      also pull off some stunts while hanging on the bar, such as 
      twirling around rapidly.

    - Mountain Biking: Pedal lots and then pedal some more as you scream
      down steep hillsides on a spindly bicycle that probably costs more
      than your car. Evel Kneivel-proportioned jumps are mandatory.

    - ATV: or quad bikes by any other name. Hammer across ramp-strewn
      tracks, trying to avoid doing a Rik Mayall, Acrobatic stunts can
      be executed in which the rider does an impression of Superman,
      barely touching the bike at all, legs a-waving.
  
    - Bungy and BASE Jumping: Leap off a bridge, antenna, span or earth
      (i.e. a mountain) and hurtle towards the unforgiving ground,
      saved only by a big piece of elastic or a hastily thrown chute.

    GAMEPLAY

    The focus is mainly on the racing so beating the field to the line
    is more important than just looking flash. Cunning use of the line
    of least resistance down the hillsides gains speed and places,
    aided by a boost gauge that lets you make an extra effort and add
    a spurt of speed at tactical moments. In most events your character
    can also lash out with their fists (terribly unsporting, but very
    extreme) and knock the opposition off their footing.
 
    SOUND AND VISION

    The craggy slopes and beachfront property most of the game takes
    place over and around looks great, helped by some glaring sun
    flare effects that'll have you fumbling for your Oakleys. 
    Particularly noteworthy is the games soundtrack, provided by the
    sublime Ninja Tune record label. 
 
    A barrage of quality hyper funky tracks from the likes of Coldcut,
    DJ Food, Amon Tobin and pals makes a nice change from the Japanese
    hand-me-downs and appalling Yankee sports metal tracks that all
    too often have you reaching for the BGM slider.

    KEY FEATURES

    - Variety of challenges
    - Soundtrack of the year
    - VMU compatible
    - Vibration Pack compatible

    IN A NUTSHELL

    There's something for everyone here, based around a solid core of 
    balls-out radical racing with a first division soundtrack.
