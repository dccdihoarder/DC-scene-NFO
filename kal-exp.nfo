   |  Here\'s another release redone that ACC raped previously. This one has |
   |  CD-DA and to make the CD-DA fit the FMV was downsampled. Run the      |
   |  UNPACK.EXE to unpack CD-DA tracks and then load up the CUE as normal. |

   |  SURRENDER IS NOT AN OPTION.                                           |
   |                                                                        |
   |  This battle takes place in the new wild frontier: SPACE. Man\'s        |
   |  ability to terraform planets has drawn the unwanted attention of the  |
   |  Charva aliens from a distant galaxy. As the Millennium Soldier, you   |
   |  must battle the aggressive aliens in an all-out war of the worlds.    |
   |  Travel through the lush texture-mapped environments that look         |
   |  incredible on Sega Dreamcast. Use the Clones to help you free the     |
   |  colonies from their alien invaders. Expendable\'s Charva population    |
   |  is superior in speed and intelligence to humans, and they can breathe |
   |  oxygen. Not only that, but they can survive in gasses normally fatal  |
   |  to humans. They do, however, have a weakness - they can\'t see too     |
   |  well, especially peripherally. So, grab your pulse rifle and endless  |
   |  supply of ammo and sneak up alongside these leathery bad boys. Will   |
   |  Planet Earth remain as we know it? Or will it become Planet Charva?   |
   |  It\'s up to you!                                                       |

   |  - Incredible 3D effects, including 360-degree texture-mapped          |
   |    environments and 3D blasting.                                       |
   |  - 20 missions in six diverse environments, plus four bonus levels.    |
   |  - One- or two-player mode.                                            |
   |  - Unique two-player mode for cooperative play.                        |
   |  - Huge stockpile of weapons, including napalm, flame throwers,        |
   |    lasers, and grenades.                                               |
