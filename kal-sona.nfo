   |  Speaking of skilled rips, we bring you the best one yet today. This   |
   |  was one of our goals when we started DC, and it has finally been      |
   |  accomplished. All sounds on this rip have been converted from Stereo  |
   |  to Mono, and just like Jet Set Radio, the difference is hardly        |
   |  noticable. The intro movie and 1 huge cut scene have also had their   |
   |  bitrates reduced. The most important part again would be that the     |
   |  the whole game is here. This is how all rips should be done, if they  |
   |  are possible. We will continue to bring you QUALITY rips only, with   |
   |  almost everything intact to have a good time. Enjoy yet another one.  |
   |                                                                        |
   |  Please note that this CD is PACKED. It had 1.2gb of data which has    |
   |  been reduced to 732. This game REQUIRES an 80 Minute CD. Do not try   |
   |  to overburn this one, It's 79:56.                                     |
