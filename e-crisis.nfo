    - --- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------>      
        
    Primal fear grabs you on this journey into survival horror from 
    the creators of Resident Evil series. Something is desperately 
    wrong. The world's most renowned scientist has disappeared and 
    you've been recruited to investigate on a mysterious, remote 
    island. Suddenly, out of the mist appears a predator which has 
    haunted mankind's imagination for centuries...experience pure terror! 

    - --- Group News --------------------------------------------------->

    And a new group breaks into the bustling Dreamcast scene. We had the 
    skills to do most things that KALISTO has done while they were doing 
    it, but hey, why bother if they're doing all releases already? Now 
    that KALISTO has stopped, we thought it would be a good time to 
    emerge and start releasing for the public. 

    We are not a bunch of newbies, actually most of us have several years
    of experience in the scene. We do ask that you leave us alone and we 
    will try to do our best for the DC scene. 

    We do not want to be contacted nor do we want any stupid rumors or 
    other shit started about us. Just keep in mind that we're doing this
    for free and not asking you to do anything in return except enjoy our
    work. We're here only to release games and have fun.
