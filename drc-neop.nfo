    Known Issues:
    There are a few known issues with this release of NeoPocott DC.  Here is
    a list:
	
    - Some games are too fast.  Some games are too slow.  We're working on a
      better throttling system and even more optimizations to make all games run
      at their proper speed.
	
    - No sound.  NeoPocott itself does not support sound, so this port does
      not either.  A future version of NeoPocott DC will have emulated Neo Geo
      Pocket Color sound as well as some user interface sounds.
  
    We put 87 NEO-GEO-POCKET Games on this release and make it selfbootable.
