   |  This futuristic battle on Sega Dreamcast takes you higher. At 60-feet |
   |  high, the Slave Zero Robot is an unbeatable adversary. Lucky it's     |
   |  been stolen away from its evil creator and is in your hands. In Slave |
   |  Zero, you must wield this towering biomechanical weapon of            |
   |  destruction and bring down SovKhan, crooked ruler of the city of      |
   |  S1-9. This towering mega-city, reaching 7 miles into the sky, is a    |
   |  hideous toxic wasteland of filth that is ruining the surrounding      |
   |  fertile area. The Guardians, descendants of an ancient clan of        |
   |  warrior priests, have launched a fierce attack to get their sacred    |
   |  land back. S1-9 is alive with people running and screaming, hovering  |
   |  cars, floating advertisements and heavy traffic. SovKhan won't be     |
   |  easy to bring down, even with Slave Zero, as he has a huge            |
   |  cyber-army and he is heavily guarded at the top of the city. The      |
   |  cyber-guards, however, don't have the iron will and resolve that      |
   |  the Guardians have. Enemies attack Slave Zero from all sides, but     |
   |  his reactions are lightening quick. Come help the Guardians bring     |
   |  the maniacal, evil ruler to his knees!                                |
   |                                                                        |
