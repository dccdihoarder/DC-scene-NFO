   |  Also a note to the people of the so called 'legitimate press':        |
   |                                                                        |

   |  folks are even worse than the typical pirate, at least the scene      |
   |  doesn't deny its roots.                                               |

   |  Genki's racing title Tokyo Xtreme Racing hit the Dreamcast last June. |
   |  The game proved to be a worthy first-generation title, and even the   |
   |  developers of the game admitted that they had used only 20 to 30      |
   |  percent of the Dreamcast's capabilities. Now, after a year, Genki     |
   |  returns with a sequel, simply titled Tokyo Xtreme Racing 2 (called    |
   |  Shutokou Battle 2 in Japan) for the Dreamcast.                        |
   |                                                                        |
   |  The graphics and the sounds of the game will be a big leap from the   |
   |  last game, and they will offer what had seemed to be lacking in the   |
   |  first title. The total length of the course is now 180km - more than  |
   |  six times the length of the course in the first game. You can now     |
   |  select from 60 different cars - twice the number found in the first   |
   |  game. You can also choose different types of aero-parts for your      |
   |  car - more than 120 types, more than four times the number of those   |
   |  available in the first game. The aero-parts not only change the look  |
   |  of your car, but they also change the car's aerodynamics, the sound   |
   |  of the muffler, and so on. Also, you can now create your own          |
   |  emblem, so you can give a personalized feel to your car.              |
   |                                                                        |
   |  There will be more than 300 kinds of rival cars to race against -     |
   |  twice the number from the first title. Previously, the players and    |
   |  rival cars were given nicknames to differentiate them from one        |
   |  another. In the sequel the developers intend to have so many          |
   |  different variations of the nickname system that you may discover     |
   |  nicknames you've never heard of.                                      |
   |                                                                        |
