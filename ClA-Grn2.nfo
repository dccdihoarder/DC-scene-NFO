   |  Finally, the game you thought you were going to be able to play       |
   |  yesterday is working! Not only does the game not freeze up anymore,   |
   |  it's also been made self-bootable, so through that boot-disc back     |                  |  into your cupboards once again. This is a REPACK of the Echelon rlz   |
   |  The movies where edited to selfboot (nothing was taken out!!)         |               
   |  Echelon left some white data after every m1v in the BTL folder, about |
   |  8 seconds on each M1V so I took that out, and replaced the M08.m1v    |
   |  (THE ONE THAT WAS CAUSING PROBLEMS) with the jap one (not downsampled)|		       |  so nothing is downsampled or ripped out other then how echelon left it|
   |  Also the Intro was taken out BUT if you wanted this game to work      |
   |  Any other way, like MysticWar's way the intro would also be taken out |
