Cool Boarders Burrrn! (*repack*) (Japanese) (CDI)

Source - Private

Repacked with permission Feb 14/05.

Fixes CDDA issue with hoo-cool.

NOTE: Unfortunately although 99.9% better than the hooligans/R18 rip.
      There is a 2 second glitch in the middle of one of the tracks.
      Therefore this game still requires a propper repack.  So you may
      want to wait.
