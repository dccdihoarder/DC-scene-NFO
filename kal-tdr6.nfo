   |  Ever wanted to push the world's hottest dream cars to their limits    |
   |  to see how they perform? Now's your chance. Just hop into a Lotus     |
   |  GT-1 or Jaguar XKR and race around the world. In this latest          |
   |  incarnation of the wildly popular racing series, Test Drive 6 is      |
   |  more realistic than ever before. A completely revamped physics model  |
   |  gives each car in its class a specific driving style and handling.    |
   |  Unexpected obstacles, collidable objects, and hairy shortcuts will    |
   |  challenge your stamina and skill. Crash through an outdoor cafe in    |
   |  Paris and send the tables airborne, or smash rickshaws in the back    | 
   |  alleys of Hong Kong. High-res graphics look awesome on Sega           |
   |  Dreamcast, and environment-specific sounds bring the tracks to life.  |
   |                                                                        |
