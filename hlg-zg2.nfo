                       Zero Gunner 2 (Jap Dc) (c) Psikyo

 DIZ:

 The shoot-em-up genre just refuses to die, and it's one of the last few
 genres where games can prevail even with lackluster graphics.
 Zero Gunner 2 is brought to use by the very same team that did Cannon Spike.
 Zero Gunner 2 boasts superlative graphics. The graphics are incredibly sharp
 and detailed, not unlike Cannon Spike 2. While CS2 had limited arenas with
 character oriented graphics, ZG2 displays large playfields with varied
 mechanized objects such as copters, planes, trains and much more.
 The bosses are a true sight to behold and they are very impressive.
 The likes of Gigawing 2 do not even come close to the graphical excellence
 of Zero Gunner 2.
