   |  Before we even start on about this release, We have to show our       |
   |  undivided respect for the folks at Utopia, What you did is truly      |
   |  impressive! Our second note would be to those lamers sitting on their |
   |  asses and begging / requesting / expecting that more DC games be      |
   |  released. You really have no right to do this, If it's so easy, why   |
   |  don't you do it yourselves? Have respect for the groups that actually |
   |  contribute to the scene, such as Utopia, Paradox, Static, Accession,  |
   |  and the 100's of others. Do not expect us or anyone else to release   |
   |  all of the games you want within the next half hour. We will do       |
   |  whatever the hell we please and you have to live with it! If you      |
   |  don't know how to use this release by now, you have no business       |
   |  using it.                                                             |

   |  rats, giant caterpillars, and much more.                              |
   |                                                                        |
