Ok this is my personal repack of Rez, its just the Hoolgians version with a 250 meg dummy file added.  The dummy file vastly improves loading times and prevents a crash when beating the level 5 boss.  

This is my first attempt at a repack and my first attempt at a full newsgroup post, so you'll have to forgive any mistakes... I've never done this stuff. 

I'd like to apologize for the size of the repack (nearly twice as big as the original game).
I used Best Compression in Winrar, I'm not really sure what else I could do.  If you want to repack my repack feel free.  

Also this might be coming up slowly, I'm a @home/rogers user and expect to be disconnected often.
