   |  Some days ago ELF released the GERMAN version of this game.    |
   |  We bring you the PAL UK version of the awesome addicting RPG.  |
   |								     |
   |  The game loosely follows the events that take place after      |
   |  the anime, "Record of Lodoss War". You play a dead warrior     |
   |  resurrected (cues in "Rise from your grave!" sound bite) by    |
   |  the powerful wizard Wart. Though you don't remember who you    |
   |  are, you assured that you were once a "powerful warrior and    |
   |  leader". You are revived to prevent an evil from taking        |
   |  control of the island Marma. You'll travel across this huge    |
   |  island in search of weapons and knowledge that will aid your   |
   |  quest, as well as finding the surviving heroes from the        |
   |  Lodoss War anime. And when I mean huge island, you'll be       |
   |  doing a lot of walking and exploring; not only are the         |
   |  dungeons enormous, but traveling from dungeon spots will       |
   |  require a lot of map viewing and time. All this comes from     |
   |  a 3D isometric view, very similar to Diablo and that's not     |
   |  the only thing that this game shares with Blizzard's mammoth   |
   |  mouse-clicker.						     |
   |								     |
   |  Again, a very addicting game with amazing artwork ... 	     |
   |                                                                 |
