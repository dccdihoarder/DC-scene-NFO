   |  Since ECHELON didn't do this one yet, we felt the need to fill the    |
   |  void. This release has absolutely nothing ripped out or downsampled!  |
   |  Never doubt the power of KALISTO, it's the force that's brought you   |
   |  hundreds and hundreds of quality console ISO releases over the last   |
   |  2 years, and we show that we are still capable of doing this time     |
   |  and time again.                                                       |

   |  Enjoy this amazing game, as we had to take quite a bit of time to     |
   |  make this one, How was it ripped? Keep trying to guess :). You can    |
   |  expect the Passport Disc tomorrow, we really don't feel like doing    |
   |  much more at 4am after working on this game for many hours, you       |
   |  have to understand that we are retired in the DC scene, and this      |
   |  is out of the ordinary for us. Anyway, Enjoy this masterpiece, as     |
   |  it's the game of the year for Dreamcast.                              |

   |  The first chapter of Yu Suzuki's epic saga is at hand. Shenmue is     |
   |  an adventure game that transports you to Japan, circa 1986. You       |
   |  are Ryo, a young man trying to solve the mystery of his father's      |
   |  death. Along the way, you'll be treated to the most richly-detailed   |
   |  game world ever conceived. Shenmue offers a true living world,        |
   |  where characters exist on their own timelines and almost all objects  |
   |  can be manipulated and used. Over the course of the adventure, you    |
   |  will learn new hand-to-hand fighting techniques, presented in         |
   |  breathtaking motion-captured animations. You'll also interact with    |
   |  literally hundreds of characters and solve a myriad of puzzles.       |
   |  It's epic storytelling at its best, and it's only on Sega Dreamcast.  |
