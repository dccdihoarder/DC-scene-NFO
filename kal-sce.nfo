   |  Hey microbe boy! Climb out of that primordial ooze and fight for the  |
   |  survival of your brand new species. In Seventh Cross Evolution on     |
   |  Sega Dreamcast, you begin as the planet's most basic, single-celled   |

   |  vegetable matter or the bodies of your enemies. To evolve, you must   |
   |  gain physical advancements such as intelligence, dexterity, defensive |
