   |  Here's another re-release of a game that NBC raped previously.        |
   |  Unrar the game and you will get the BIN, CUE, and UNPACK.EXE. Run     |
   |  UNPACK.EXE to unpack the audio tracks, then load the CUE into CDRWIN  |
   |  as normal.                                                            |

   |  Also, we have included a RGB FIX for this release, The previously     |
   |  released one will not work on this release. The RGB FIX is included   |
   |  in KAL-CENT.ZIP, So Unzip that and Apply the PPF to the BIN if you    |
   |  are using an RGB Cable.                                               |
