   |  Today we bring you the first self-booting WinCE game. Notice that     |
   |  this game is 2 CD's, and it operates the same way as Resident Evil:   |
   |  Code Veronica did, You can save your game at the end of CD1, and      |
   |  resume at CD2, and vice versa because each CD represents a different  |
   |  character. CD1 is Leon and CD2 is Claire. The movies had to be        |
   |  downsampled to make this one fit and also it requires 80 Minute CD's. |
   |  This release is also PAL and NTSC compatible, NTSC users should note  |
   |  that all of the menu choices on startup for videomodes are PAL,       |
   |  however if you choose PAL/60HZ it will run fine on NTSC. Enjoy.       |
   |                                                                        |
   |  A little note to the emulamer community, and more specifically the    |
   |  author of Gleam:                                                      |
   |                                                                        |
   |  We noticed that you ripped off our self-booting work to make your     |
   |  lame emulator, and we're sure many emulator authors will follow the   |
   |  way and start developing WinCE emulators using our code once again.   |
   |  Start crediting your sources when you rip off the code byte for byte  |
   |  from our self-booting games. It's common sense that if you use        |
   |  someone else's work DIRECTLY, you should give them the credit for it. | 
   |                                                                        |

   |  It's the worst possible nightmare: a new virus runs rampant. All of   |
   |  Raccoon City is infested. Blood-thirsty zombies, hideous mutations    |
   |  now, overwhelm the community. When Leon and Claire arrive in town     |
   |  their nightmare is just beginning.                                    |
   |                                                                        |

   |  defined the genre.                                                    |
   |                                                                        |
   |  Raccoon City continues to endure an onslaught of horror and fear.     |
   |  Mysterious, flesh-eating chemicals have spread into the town and is   |
   |  now overwhelming almost everyone. New terrifying creatures of the     |
