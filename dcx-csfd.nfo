Maximize for best results.

What is it?:  Capcom Vs. SNK 2 Fan Disc (Limited Edition) Enjoy!
	      My one and only release. Buy the rest of the DC games.

Why?: Cuz no one's posted it and I thought I'd give back for once.
      Plus, I had to test out my BBA. It's a rare item and it has
      alot of downloadable saves for Capcom games. I did this for
      a good friend of mine and I'll do it for the board. Someone
      please do a FAQ on the disc... it needs a good translation.

Self-Boot/Ripped?: It's all here, wasted 5 CD-R's tryin to do selfboot!

Compatible with 8cm discs?: Depends on your burner and overburning.
			    Maybe... Maybe not. Worked for me.

PAR's?: Wish I could but it'd take too long for me. It's small enough
	that I'll try to repost when I get the chance again.

Greetz?: Everyone and all the groups who ripped and posted on their 
	 own time. Thanks for making the system and games worth buying.
	 Especially Echelon.

Slams?:  Anyone who unzips this, repacks it, and uploads it as their
	 own groups work. Leechers don't understand how long it takes. =P
	 And anyone who owns a DC and no original discs. Fork out some money
	 for the good titles. Don't cry when your CD-R's flake on you.

DCX's Slogan:  "Be Original, Buy Original" and "Mod only for imports".
	       Cuz IF a system has to be sold, it's definetly worth
	       more if you have originals than bootlegs on generic
	       CD-R's.  My DC collection alone could probably put a 
	       down payment on a car! But why would I sell my Dreamcast? =)
	       Plus publishers get paid for what they do and if they don't
	       get paid, why do a sequel?  Except for M$.
