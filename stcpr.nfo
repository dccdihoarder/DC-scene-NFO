 Description:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~

 This quirky budget-priced game lets you go online and hobnob with other
 Dreamarenauts as they wander about a pint-size planet, playing one of four
 funky games and chatting away in the bubbling and lively Information Centre.
 You can have a go at 'Dream Dorobo', which involves guiding another
 partially sighted player through a police-infested maze via the lovely DC
 microphone or undertake a cunning sea-based strategy battle between ships
 with vocal guidance (enigmatically named 'Kosejik').
 'Ball Bubble' demands you manipulate a flat surface to roll away a load of
 balls from your three online opponents and into your territory, while
 'Soar' is a tale of gently floating balloons. As time goes by you'll be
 able to vote for which games you want to stay and which get swapped for new
 ones every few months, meaning Planet Ring is an ambitiously open-ended
 experience.
