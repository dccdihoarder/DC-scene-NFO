      `- Proudly Presents:

      Game.....: Dreamcast Self-Booting Tutorial (C) Echelon

      Origin...: USA - NTSC           -  Filename.....: E-SELFBT.ZIP
      Released.: September 19th, 2000 -  Format.......: Toolset
      Platform.: Sega Dreamcast (DC)  -  CD(s)........: You Choose

    - --- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------> 
         
    Here's something that you have almost all been waiting for, the
    ability to make your own games self-boot. Please note that this
    tutorial is meant for somewhat experienced users, and it is not
    a simple click and play program. Doing a simple program where you
    just click buttons is very hard to do for self-booting disks as 
    they all differ so much. This tutorial will work and has been
    tested to work with WinCE & CDDA games. It also explains in depth
    how to go about booting both of the above. Follow the instructions
    in TUTORIAL.TXT in this archive for more info on using this.

    Please take prior notice that this WILL NOT work with all burners,
    and it is not meant to. If cdrecord fails on you, do NOT bitch 
    at us, we did NOT write that program. Thank you.
