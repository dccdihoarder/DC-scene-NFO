   |  Today we bring you something that the other groups are unable to      |
   |  produce no matter how hard they try. Folks, this is the first CDDA    |
   |  release. It was also a WinCE game and cracked to work with the        |
   |  current bootloader. All FMV in-game had to be downsampled to have the |
   |  88 CDDA tracks fit on & play. Note this game is 76 Mins Long, We      |
   |  recommend using an 80 Minute Blank for this. This is a game Developed |

   |  Hello to Accession for making fools of yourselves and saying that     |
   |  CDDA is not possible with the current boot loader, the loader has     |
   |  nothing to do with it at all, Stop blaming others for your lameness.  |
   |  We prove you wrong again with the first CDDA game.                    |
