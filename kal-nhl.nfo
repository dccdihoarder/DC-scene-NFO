   |  Hit the ice in the coolest hockey sim. in console gaming history! NHL |
   |  2K continues the winning tradition of previous Sega Sports hits for   |
   |  the Sega Dreamcast arena, such as NFL 2K and NBA 2K. You'll get the   |
   |  same hard-hitting gameplay and gut-gripping realism for total         |
   |  hockey immersion. Fully licensed by the NHL and NHLPA, NHL 2K is      |
   |  the most realistic hockey simulation game on the market today. You    |
   |  can almost feel the brutal crunch of contact from a dive on the ice   |
   |  or an all-out brawl. Can you pull off a triple-scoring hat trick?     |
   |  How about a quicksilver flip pass over an unsuspecting opponent?      |
   |  If you've got blades of steel and nerves to match, then play that     |
   |  puck like a sharp-shooting pro, and score the Cup for your superstar  |
   |  team. Just don't get stuck in the penalty box.                        |
   |                                                                        |
