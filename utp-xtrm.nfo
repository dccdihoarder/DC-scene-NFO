 | First it was the wide-open roads of the U.S.A. Next stop - the crowded   |
 | Tokyo highways. Your addiction to raw horsepower and pedal-to-the-metal  |
 | action has driven you to build the most powerful racing machine outside  |
 | of Indy. Now, Tokyo's underground cult of midnight street racing lures   |
 | you to its ultimate speed demon challenge. The tricked-out Sega          |
 | Dreamcast version roars with enhanced graphics, extra modes, and new     |
 | options. Choose from more than 25 customizable racecars, each with over  |
 | 100 accessories to improve performance. Different race modes allows you  |
 | to compete head-to-head, beat the clock, use your wins to upgrade your   |
 | wheels, or use your lead to deplete your opponent's power. Better learn  |
 | how to say "I accept this trophy" in Japanese.                           |
