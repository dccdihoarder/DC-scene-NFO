Ikaruga (J) (fixed to run at 60hz on PAL DC's)

I've patched the wt-ika iso
I've tested this on my PAL DC & it works fine.
Runs at 60hz + Full screen + much faster.
Burnt it with DJ 4.
RAR used V3.00
Thanks go out to the people who did this patch
I'm sorry I don't know who you are.

P.S I don't know if this will run on US or JAP DC's
so burn at your own risk.
