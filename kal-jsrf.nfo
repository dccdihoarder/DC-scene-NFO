   |  Fixes a looping problem with a few of the converted music files in    |
   |  JSR. The problem was visible as distorted and stuttering sound in     |
   |  menus, and silence eventually. Also note that this problem has been   |
   |  fixed for our release of Sonic Adventure. Apply this PPF to your      |
   |  BIN/CUE of Jet Set Radio JAP, Make sure it is our original release or |
   |  it will not work. You cannot apply this to a BIN which has a dummy    |
   |  file or something similar.                                            |

   |  individuals that will help you keep your area the way you want it.    |

   |  cartoon-style characters are pumped up with polygons so they come     |
   |  alive in 3D on Sega Dreamcast. Uniqueness is key to these kids and    |
   |  each character stands apart with exclusive abilities and style.       |
   |  They like to show off too, and with 18 missions, there's plenty of    |
   |  time to impress. It's fast, it's fun, and it's definitely funky.      |
