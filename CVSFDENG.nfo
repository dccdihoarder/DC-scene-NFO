| Release Notes / Game Features						|
|         								|
| This Japanese-Only Fandisk started floating around the net lately.	|
| All text items have been translated into English. A Few items are     |
| pictures and thus not translated with the patch. Since it is not a	|
| recompiled version, the layout of the text can be shifted to the left |
| or right too much. But at least it is understandable			|
|									|
|  3 Sections Available :						|
|  - CapCom VS SNK #1 and #1 replay data                          	|
|  - Illustration Gallery with all CVS characters (multiple images)     |
|  - Save Games and cheats for several (Japanese) CapCom games		|
|									|
| CVS replay can be used to  view some really impressive moves from the |
| best Japanese CVS players at the Japanese CVS National Grand 		|
| Championship.	The Replay Data is downloaded in the VMU and can then   |
| be used in CVS1 or CVS2.						|
|									|
| Since this is a Japanese CD, not all features may work. If one does	|
| not work, then try the Japanese version of the game.			|
|									|
| For more details on the moves and specials, see the CVS FAQ included	|
| in this package. If it is missing, that stinks! Try to get the	| 
| original or look at http://www.gamefaq.com/				|
