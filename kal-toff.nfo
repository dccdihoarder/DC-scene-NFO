   |  You don't need to know your birdies from your bogies in Tee-Off, the  |
   |  first golf title to debut on Sega Dreamcast. Wacky, arcade-style      |
   |  action is the name of this game as you play as one of 15 Japanese     |
   |  anime-style golfers, each with different abilities and personalities. |
   |  Before you start, take advantage of the sweeping, panoramic view of   |
   |  each course to form your strategy. With each shot, choose a club      |
   |  based on the ball position and course layout, and determine the force |
   |  of your swing. Novice players are given a boost with useful tips and  |
   |  multiple handicap levels. Hit the fairway with up to four of your     |
   |  golf-happy buddies, or go head-to-head against the system for some    |
   |  fast-swinging, putt-sinking fun.                                      |
   |                                                                        |
