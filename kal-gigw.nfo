   |  music is still kept intact and so are all sound effects. This game    |
   |  also fits on a 74 Min Blank. Have fun.                                |

   |  GEAR UP THE HARDWARE, WE'RE UNDER LIVE FIRE!                          |
   |                                                                        |
   |  Fans of shooters are in for the ultimate test of reflex and skill     |
   |  with Capcom's release of its arcade shooter Giga Wing for Sega        |
   |  Dreamcast. The top-down graphics and stereo sound have been ported    |
   |  perfectly from the arcade version, and the bullets are flying         |
   |  non-stop! You'll face down flaming death, with your only protection   |
   |  provided by a cautiously rationed shield function. Each player picks  |
   |  their primary weapon at the outset of the game; power-ups provide     |
   |  strength and functions for this weapon. You'll also be provided with  |
   |  smart bombs, which will destroy all onscreen enemies. At the end of   |
   |  each level, you'll go mano-a-mano with an oversized, over-armored,    |
   |  and overpowered boss. Get in the pilot's seat and let's rage!         |
   |                                                                        |
   |  - Four Modes of play - Arcade, Score Attack Mode, Gallery and         |
   |    Training.                                                           |
   |  - Graphically impressive terrain.                                     |
   |  - Revolutionary Reflect Response shield deflects enemy fire, but it   |
   |    must be recharged after each use.                                   |
   |  - Choose from many different primary weapons, including homing        |
   |    missiles, side-fire cannons, heavy bombs and lasers.                |
   |  - Collect pieces of destroyed enemy ships for bonus points.           |
   |  - Score Multiplier -- rack up astronomical scores based on player     |
   |    skill.                                                              |
   |  - Level-end bosses will challenge your ingenuity.                     |
