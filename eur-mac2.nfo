   |  Game Info:                                                          |
   |  ----------                                                          |
   |                                                                      |
   |  In the game, you play a student in a high school - I believe you're |
   |  supposed to be the same guy from part 1, as you keep on having      |
   |  memories of the Marionette from the original game.                  |
   |                                                                      |
   |  One day, you stumble upon a pair of abandoned marionettes, one      |
   |  called Marine and the other called Maria. You take Marine under     |
   |  your care while a rival and all-together obnoxious classmate called |
   |  Arese takes Maria under hers'. Arese is under the impression that   |
   |  marionettes are nothing more than robots with a heart made of       |
   |  computer circuits, but your experience with part 1, where you       |
   |  apparently managed to raise the original marionette to near human   |
   |  form, has you convinced otherwise, and you intend to prove          |
   |  Arese wrong.                                                        |
   |                                                                      |

   |  We still need a few more sites, so if you run a good site join      |
   |  #eurasia on efnet. It is a plus if you have a MP3 section, but      |
   |  if you are only looking for console decoration of your PC courier   |
   |  site then don't bother asking.                                      |
