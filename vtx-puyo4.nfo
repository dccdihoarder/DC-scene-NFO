| The Puyo Puyo series has been known by many names in the US, the most       |
| notable being Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine for the Genesis and Kirby's  |
| Avalanche for the SNES. Not to be confused with Puyo Puyo DA!, Puyo Puyo 4  |
| is the latest installment in this long-running series of puzzle games.      |
|                                                                             |
| Puyo Puyo 4 sticks to the same basic premise as every other Puyo Puyo game  |
| out there: Different colored blobs fall, two at a time, into your well.     |
| You must connect four or more similarly colored blobs together to clear     |
| them.                                                                       |
|                                                                             |
| Puyo Puyo 4 is lotsa fun, and fairly addictive, despite the complete lack   |
| of any English in the game, let alone some semblance of a plot. Oh well,    |
| guess you can't ask for everything.                                         |
|                                                                             |

| This game originally had a shit load of crappy CDDA music, over an hour's   |
| worth. It was either kill the opening movie, or kill the CDDA. Since the    |
| music was so annoying, we figured most people could live without it. Sorry. |
|                                                                             |

| choice is to play the game!), then check out:                               |
