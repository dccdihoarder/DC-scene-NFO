INTRODUCTION

Defense Commander is a mini-game / technology demo. There are two versions, 
one for PC and one for Dreamcast. The Dreamcast version runs under Microsoft's
Windows CE operating system.


HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS (PC):

Defense Commander has fairly heavy system requirements. A 350MHz machine with
a 16 meg 3D video card is a rough minimum for running Defense Commander in
high detail mode. Voodoo 1 and 2 video cards are not supported. Various 
configuration options are available during startup to allow you to better tune
the game to your system. The game has been successfully tested on Voodoo 3,
G400 and TNT systems.

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS (PC):

DirectX 7 run-time installed.


THE GAME

You, the player, control a gun turret in the center of a small city. You must
defend your turret and the city against waves of attacking craft. The game 
proceeds in stages. Each stage is more difficult than the previous and there
are infinitely many stages. If you can get past stage 10, you are doing well.

Attacking craft are of the following types:

Power Up Drone:  These small red ships fly in formations of 5 or more. They do
                 not attack. If you destroy all ships in a formation a power
                 up will appear. There are five different formations, each of
                 which give a different power up. To receive the power up you
                 must shoot it.

Gunship Fighter: Red ships which attack your turret with guns.

Rocket Fighter:  Yellow ships which attack your turret with rockets. They do
                 more damage than the red gunship fighters but are slower.

Bomber:          Large blue ships which drop bombs on the city. Once all
                 buildings in the city are destroyed they will drop bombs on
                 your turret. Be warned, a single bomb will destroy your
                 turret.

You have the following weapons at your disposal:

Guns:            Your primary form of defense. You have unlimited amunition.
                 Some power ups will give the guns enhanced capabilities
                 for short periods.

Missiles:        Missiles lock onto a target and will seek towards that
                 target until it is destroyed. You have unlimted missiles.
                 You must wait for the missile lock to engage before a
                 missile can be fired. Missiles do more damage than a single
                 gun shot.

Smart Bomb:      Smart bombs instantly destroy all enemy objects including
                 craft, weapons fire and power ups. Smart bombs are limited
                 so are best used sparingly.

The following power ups are available during the game:

Damage Repair:   Repairs up to 50% of the damage to the turret.

Smart Bomb:      Gives you another smart bomb.

Rapid Fire:      Doubles the rate of fire of guns.

Explosive Tip:   The guns do a lot more damage to the enemy ships. This
                 power up will override rapid fire.

Seeker:          The gun fire will seek towards the craft they are fired at.
                 You must fire in the general direction of the craft you
                 wish to hit.  This power up will override rapid fire and
                 explosive tip.

During game play, the following information is displayed to assist you:

Damage Indicators: The bottom right of the screen has two damage indicator
                 bars, one for the city and one for the turret. When a 
                 damage level is becoming critical the bar will turn red.

Smart Bombs:     The number of available smart bombs is displayed in the
                 bottom left of the screen.

Radar:           A radar is located at the left of the screen. Larger objects
                 appear larger on the radar.

Gun Power Up:    The currently active power up (if any) will be indicated on
                 the right of the screen by a small icon. A bar indicates the
                 amount of the power up remaining.


CONTROLS

Mouse (PC only): Moving the mouse controls direction. Left mouse button fires
                 guns, right mouse button fires missiles and center mouse
                 button (if any) triggers smart bomb.

Dreamcast Controller: Analog pad controls direction. Button X fires guns, 
                 button Y fires missiles, button B triggers smart bomb. The
                 Start button can be used to both start and quit a game. Right
                 trigger will pause/unpause time.  Left trigger will toggle in
                 and out of observer mode. While in observer mode you can move
                 around using the directional pad. Use controller port 2.
