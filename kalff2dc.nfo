   |  THIS 'BORG IS BAD NEWS.                                               |
   |                                                                        |
   |  It's mankind's ultimate weapon and greatest threat: a killer cyborg   |
   |  with no limits and no conscience. This human clone is in prototype    |
   |  stage and will soon be unleashed on the world -- and only one man     |
   |  can stop it. The CIA's top agent Hawk Manson is back in Fighting      |
   |  Force 2 on Sega Dreamcast. Go undercover as Hawk and infiltrate the   |
   |  evil corporation's R & D facilities. Discover as much as you can      |
   |  about their secret project, and destroy the 'borg at all costs. This  |
   |  mission takes both muscle and brains as you negotiate the convoluted  |
   |  research labs and fight off a legion of guards. Whether you're        |
   |  stealing blueprints or tracking down escaped mutants, every move is   |
   |  crucial. You must choose the right tactics for each scenario, such    |
   |  as an ambush or a storming assault. World peace and your own survival |
   |  depend on your strategy, stealth, and sheer fighting force.           |
   |                                                                        |
