   |  HEY SNOWBOARD WARRIORS...                                             |
   |                                                                        |
   |  Battle the elements, your board buddies, and your own personal best   |
   |  in Rippin' Riders, the red-hot snowboarding title on Sega Dreamcast.  |
   |  Compete as one of six main characters, each with their own unique     |
   |  BGM style, specialty tricks, and combos. In Free Ride mode, you'll    |
   |  shred through miles of wild and wintery terrain, racking up points    |
   |  along the way with your best turbo-boosting stunts. If you're a       |
   |  trickster at heart, then pump that board to the top of the pipe and   |
   |  bust some eye-poppin' air in Super Pipe mode. Score high and get a    |
   |  chance to show your stuff on the Extra Super Pipe, a combo run of     |
   |  trail and long stretches of halfpipe that'll keep you riding that     |
   |  adrenaline wave. If your buddy throws down the glove for an all-out   |
   |  challenge, then beat him in a slew of different races in Match Race   |
   |  mode. Keep on ripping it up and uncover hidden courses, boards,       |
   |  characters, and features. This game won't break your bones -- it'll   |
   |  blow your mind.                                                       |
