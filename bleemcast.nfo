Burn with DiscJuggler, tell DiscJuggler NO when it asks if you want to repair the image.
Yes it plays backups.
No it doesnt work with all games, some games have graphical errors.
Yes its self booting.
Yes this is a beta, bleemcast.
This is the BLUE version.
Just in case you're wondering about the other 4 versions/colors of bleemcast... the person who cracked it found they are all identical.

Props to the folks that made this happen!
