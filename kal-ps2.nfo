   |  Very nice sequel to PowerStone. Burns onto a 74 Min Fine.             |

   |  Also a note to the people of the so called 'legitimate press':        |
   |                                                                        |
   |  Please take a moment and look at yourselves before you go on your     |
   |  writing campaigns against piracy. I am 100% absolutely positive that  |
   |  you fuckers have and take part of our so called 'scene'. Yes, you     |
   |  folks are even worse than the typical pirate, at least the scene      |
   |  doesn't deny its roots.                                               |
   |                                                                        |

   |  ~~~~~~~~~~                                                            |
   |  Power Stone 2, based on the Naomi-hardware arcade game, adds several  |
   |  interesting things to the popular 3D fighting game. For starters,     |
   |  the game now supports up to four players. This makes two-on-two       |
   |  battles possible. But the amazing backgrounds greatly overshadow      |
   |  any other addition. What makes the backgrounds so incredible?         |
   |  Interactivity. One level has you carry on the battle while you run    |
   |  away from a gigantic Indiana Jones-style rolling boulder. Along the   |
   |  run you can pick up a skateboard and use it to stay ahead of the      |
   |  boulder, while trying to trip up your opponents in an attempt to      |
   |  crush them. Another level puts you on top of two submarines. As       |
   |  they occasionally submerge and resurface, you'll have to hop back     |
   |  and forth between the two boats. The tops of the subs have turrets    |
   |  that you can man, and even a little hovership that lets you float     |
   |  around above the surface and drop bombs on the fighters below.        |
   |                                                                        |
   |  The graphics are roughly the same as the original Power Stone's,      |
   |  but since you're seeing more characters on-screen, the chracters      |
   |  are a little smaller. Also, because of the wild backgrounds, the      |
   |  action moves along at a much faster pace. But even though the         |
   |  game is even more action-packed than the original, the                |
   |  backgrounds add a lot of strategy to the game. Now, you don't         |
   |  simply hop around small levels kicking each other in an attempt       |
   |  to collect all three Power Stones. Now you've got to think about      |
   |  where you're going to land, as well as which harmful obstacle you     |
   |  can knock your enemy into next.                                       |
   |                                                                        |
   |  The Dreamcast version looks just about as good as the arcade          |
   |  version, and it looks as though the DC version will contain an        |
   |  online component similar to that of the recently-released             |
   |  Capcom fighter, Marvel vs. Capcom 2. This means Japanese players      |
   |  will have to pay an additional fee to play online, but they'll get    |
   |  better response times this way than they would if the game simply     |
   |  hooked up to the Internet.                                            |
   |                                                                        |
   |  Fans of the original Power Stone will be pleased with the similar,    |
   |  yet definitely enhanced feel of Power Stone 2. Even with only two     |
   |  players, it's still a lot of fun, plus the game is significantly      |
   |  more balanced than its predecessor.                                   |
   |                                                                        |
