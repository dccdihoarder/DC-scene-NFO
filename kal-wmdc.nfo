   |  Man is no match for the deathly machines that turned ugly in Wild     |
   |  Metal on Sega Dreamcast. These highly dangerous military monsters     |
   |  have designed their own mission:                                      |
   |                                                                        |

   |  For hundreds of years, these metal maniacs have ruled the 3 planets   |
   |  of the Tehric system, but mankind is coming back with a vengeance.    |
   |  You are an intergalactic bounty hunter sent to reclaim all 24 power   |
   |  cores and wipe out these menaces. Scale the vast landscapes in one    |
   |  of the five amazingly-detailed tanks. You won't want to leave the     |
   |  21 levels of diverse terrain that will trip you up with several       |
   |  surprises. There are more weapons than you'll know what to do with,   |
   |  including several projectile bad boys, so the cantankerous            |
