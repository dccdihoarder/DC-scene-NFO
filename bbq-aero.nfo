If you want to sit in the Aerowings machine you have to not be a fat and have
so much TITS! You know it right! (.)(.) or maybe (o)(o) big nipple or maybe
small? It's is upto you but remember that I don't think its cool to be a boy
and have TITS!! Look at this, since the people are fat I make a new recipe
for you to fly it fast and not a slow ASS!%#$ Also know I love it like 14 Feb
for valentine AHAHAHAAH

-----\Cut Here\-----
BBQ BruhS BBQ Bird!!!! (eating bird make you fly like a fucking AeroWings)

First!! When you BBQ smaller wild bird like dove, quail, chuckar, grouse, etc
it sometimes is a little on the dry side. (I Hate Dry!, Bad like dry Pussy!)
This recipe will fix that problem. (For the bird, not the pussy!!!!)

Make sure you have it all here before continue! I'm not going responsible for
assholes who waste food!!! Remember it!!!

8 Birds of your choice,                       1 Pound Fresh Bacon,
Halfcup Italian Salad Dressing                1 Tablespoon Paprika
1 Teaspoon Ground Sage                        Half teaspoon garlic powder
Salt and pepper

Marinate birds in Italian salad dressing overnight time. Pat dry, season with
paprika, ground sage, garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste (IMPORTANT!!!)

Wrap each bird with bacon slices. If you use more than one slice of bacon to
cover the bird match the seams on the same side. Place the birds on a
medium-hot grill, bacon seam side down. Cover and grill for 15 minute. Turn
and grill another more 15 minutes. Test the bird with a fork, if it is not
tender soft cook another 15 minutes. Okay?

Baked beans, stuffing, fresh vegetables, and bread of your choice would be
a good fucking thing for this food to be best!. After your birds are done
throw the bacon into your pot of baked beans for excellent seasoning. This
recipe also works so very well with Cornish game hens.

After it you will eat it and say :)))))))) if you are ;(((( it is because you
are making it so much fucking wrong! Don't msg me to say "Oh BBQ BruHs?!" I
don't care!!!!!!!
