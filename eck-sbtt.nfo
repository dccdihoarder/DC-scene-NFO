 . As for the last release (sbtt) we noticed a few ppl had . 
 . reporting that music was playing during game play. The  . 
 . release was TESTED before it went out and didn't have   . 
 . the problem. Apparently a few Dreamcasts will play the  . 
 . selfbooting cd audio track and a few will not.  Well    . 
 . enjoy this Repack release of SBTT with cdda from Ecko.  . 
 . By the way. The reason we are doing these releases like . 
 . virtua fighter 3tb jap when the usa has been done       . 
 . already, is because we are just trying to release the   . 
 . versions that have not been done. For all you guys know . 
 . some people might want the jap version. And also the    . 
 . releases like vf3 tb are NOT DUPES. VF3tb was the real  . 
 . japanese version. So this rip was NOT dupe. We could    . 
 . care less of what you think about our releases, so      . 
 . bitching is really not gonna get anything changed.      .
