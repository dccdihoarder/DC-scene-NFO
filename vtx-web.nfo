| Although it's still a long ways from 3.0, this newest version of the        |
| PlanetWeb browser has been improved significantly over previous versions.   |
| As well as some bug fixes and minor improvements, a couple of cool new      |
| features have been added. First, the browser now has mouse support. More    |
| interesting though is the addition of "Dreamcall", which allows you to      |
| make phone calls to other Dreamcall users over the net using your DC and    |
| the Seaman Microphone.                                                      |

| "After getting my broadband adapter, I needed a tool to set the ip address  |
| for the broadband ip slave so that I can do some real development on it.    |
| So, thanks to atari65xe for ripping the game and sending me the dump, I'm   |
| able to provide a nice release of the WebBrowser 2.6.  Since I didn't       |
| want everyone to download a cd full of demos and crap, I proceeded to       |
| systematically rip out  everything from the feb dreamcast issue except      |
| the browser.  After ripping out the superfluous demo program to choose      |
| programs, the Sega Swirl, and a bunch of crappy demos, the browser is       |
| only a 4 meg download.  It is a DiscJuggler 2 image.  After booting         |
| it up, I discovered to my dismay that it doesn't even support the god       |
| damn broadband adapter!  So, if anyone has the v3.0 Japanese Browser        |
| or the Configuration Tools for the broadband adapter, send mail to          |

| most things, only time will tell. Maybe we'll get bored. :-) Anyhow, we're  |
