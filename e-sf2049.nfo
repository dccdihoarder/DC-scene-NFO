      `- Proudly Presents:

      Game.....: San Francisco Rush 2049 * Cracked * (C) Midway / Atari

      Released.: September 20th, 2000 -  Format.......: DiscJuggler (CDI)
      Platform.: Sega Dreamcast (DC)  -  CD(s)........: 1
      CD1 Info.: 28 RARS / 74 MINS    -  Ripped.......: Music Downsampled

    - --- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------> 

    Echelon has come through again, with this fully cracked quality
    release.

    This game had a total of 4 copy protections.  It's the first serious
    attempt at protecting a game - UFC, which Kalisto cracked, was
    hardly serious :).  It took several crackers and about 2 weeks for
    us to finally get this done.  We've learned a lot from this.
    Hopefully it won't take so long next time.

    In non-protection news, this game had to have its music downsampled.
    It was just too big.  No FMVs were downsampled; not that there were
    many anyway.

    ***NOTE TO SEGA***:  Did you know that Midway violated the developer
    agreement by doing a kernel RAM checksum?  If future Dreamcasts were
    to have a different GD-ROM kernel, the legitimate Rush 2049 would
    not work on it.  If you approved it, that's fine then.
   
    Last thing.  Sorry about DDR Club Mix's botched NFO.  It should have
    said that crappy songs were downsampled to 8 bit and/or mono, and
    that the release requires an 80 minute CD-R.
