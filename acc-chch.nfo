 | CAT AND MOUSE CHOAS IN CYBERSPACE!                                       |
 |                                                                          |
 | Blast-off with Sega's first-ever networked title: ChuChu Rocket. It's    |
 | the age-old game of cat and mouse -- with a cyber-twist. Sega makes      |
 | gaming history by hooking up your Dreamcast to the world. Now you can    |
 | take on a group of online strangers in an all-out battle over the        |
 | Internet! It takes only a few minutes to learn ChuChu Rocket. All you    |
 | have to do is herd your ChuChus (space mice) into their rocket before    |
 | the KapuKapu (scary space cats) catch up to them. The game may seem      |
 | simple, but don't be fooled. Your brain will shift into warp speed amid  |
 | the fast and furious chasin, mind-bending puzzles, multi-player teamwork |
 | and your opponent's sneaky tricks. Catch the mystery mice and a timed    |
 | event throws everyone's strategy out of whack. Whatever you play solo,   |
 | or play the nation, you'll get infected with ChuChu fever.               |
 |                                                                          |
 | Features:                                                                |
 |           * Online multiplaying gaming                                   |
 |           * Lobby instantly matches you up with players                  |
 |           * Five addictive gameplay modes: puzzle, stage challenge, four |
 |             player battle, team battle, and network battle               |
 |           * More than 75 massive levels                                  |
 |           * Puzzle editor allows you to make your own puzzles            |
 | =========================================================================|
 | SPECIAL NOTE:                                                            |
 | All music has been ripped from this game FOR A REASON. Like Snow Surfers |
 | the music for this game is done with CDDA, not file-streamed audio. For  |
 | whatever reason, it is not possible for cracked DC games to playback     |
 | CDDA audio when using Utopia's Boot Loader v1.1. If CDDA playback        |
 | becomes available in the future you can expect updates from us! And a    |
 | message to those who scream that other releases have CDDA. Listen, "This |
 | is a Dreamcast disc..." ;)                                               |
