   Game Info:
   ----------
   Neverland has created a 3D action/RPG that should appeal to fans of the
   anime and give Dreamcast players a solid dungeon crawling and monster
   slaying fun.

   The game loosely follows the events that take place after the anime,
   "Record of Lodoss War". You play a dead warrior resurrected. You'll
   travel across this huge island in search of weapons and knowledge that
   will aid your quest, as well as finding the surviving heroes from the
   Lodoss War anime. All this comes from a 3D isometric view, very
   similar to Diablo and that's not the only thing that this game shares
   with Blizzard's mammoth mouse-clicker.

   The game's visuals are pretty good, though there are a few flaws here
   and there. The 3D models of enemies and characters aren't very detailed,
   and while they animate well, they also look like they "float" when they
   move. Special effects of spells and attacks are pretty slick and it's
   really impressive when you finally get a party of three taking on
   a horde of goblins.
