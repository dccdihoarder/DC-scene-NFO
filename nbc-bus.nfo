 | Tokyo Bus Guide is a driving simulation simular to Crazy Taxi. Except in this   |
 | one you have to obey to the rules of the road, which makes it more challenging  |
 | and fun! In the story mode, you'll have to take part in a variety of different  | 
 | raining modes and missions, but the arcade mode allows you to roam freely around|
 | the cities and go wherever you heart desires! Enjoy our third release for the   |
 | wonderful platform that is DC.                                                  |

 | We were hesitating on bringing this one out, but we decided that all you retards|
 | at DCisos.com needed another release. Great job obeying our last nfo guys. Not  |
