   |  Today we bring you another CD-DA & WinCE game, this requires an 80    |
   |  Minute Blank so make sure you have one around. Note that most of the  |
   |  FMV was downsampled to make the huge audio tracks fit on here.        |
   |                                                                        |
   |  Please take note, that we have taken a new approach to packaging      |
   |  this game.  Rather than wasting your download time and bandwidth      |
   |  downloading a BIN/CUE version with all the audio tracks in WAVE       |
   |  form, we have included the data track as a .BIN, with all the audio   |
   |  tracks in MP3 format.  Simply run UNPACK.EXE in the directory in      |
   |  which you un-RAR'd, and you will get all the CD-DA tracks in .WAV     |
   |  format.  Now, you can load the CUE sheet into CDRWIN.  Pretty nifty,  |
   |  huh?  Thanks to our friends at CLASS/BACKLASH for the idea and for    |
   |  the unpacker tool.  Expect most of our CDDA games to be packaged      |
   |  this way when it can save large amounts of space - This release was   |
   |  35 RARS without MP3's, and 10 with.                                   |
   |                                                                        |

   |  It's the end of the worm world as we know it! In Worms Armageddon on  |

   |  fool you - you need all the strategy and skill you can muster to      |
